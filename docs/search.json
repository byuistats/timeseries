Sometimes differencing can remove trends.\nConsider the case of a random walk and a linear trend with white noise errors\n\nRandom Walk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nConsider the random walk\n\\[\n  x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is a white noise process.\n\nWhat is the model for the first differences of this time series?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Trend with White Noise Errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nConsider a time series with a linear trend and white noise errors.\n\\[\n  x_t = a + bt + w_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is a white noise process.\n\nWhat is the model for the first differences of this time series? \nWhat is the model obtained by subtracting \\(a+bt\\) from this series? \nWhat are some potential concerns of using differencing to eliminate a deterministic trend? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting an ARIMA Model when the Difference Model has a Non-Zero Mean\n(See the last sentence in the first paragraph on page 138.)\n\n\nDifferencing a Time Series or the Logarithm of a Time Series\nIf the difference of a time series demonstrates an increasing trend, taking the logarithm before differencing can eliminate the increasing variation in the differences. As an example, consider the Australian electricity production series given in the book.\n\n\nShow the code\npacman::p_load(\"tsibble\", \"fable\", \"feasts\",\n    \"tsibbledata\", \"fable.prophet\",\n    \"tidyverse\", \"patchwork\")\ncbe &lt;- read_table(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/cbe.dat\") |&gt;\n  select(elec) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    date = seq(\n      ymd(\"1958-01-01\"),\n      by = \"1 months\",\n      length.out = n()),\n      year_month = tsibble::yearmonth(date)) |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = year_month)\n\ncbe |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    `Diff series` = elec - lag(elec),\n    `Diff log-series` = log(elec) - lag(log(elec))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(c(\"elec\", \"Diff series\", \"Diff log-series\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(name = factor(name, levels =c(\"elec\",\"Diff series\", \"Diff log-series\"))) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 1, scales = \"free\", strip.position = \"left\") +\n  labs(x = \"Time\", y = \"\") +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = \"5 years\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plot of Australian electricity production, first differences, and first differences of the logarithm of the series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Time Series of Order d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of an Integrated Series of Order \\(d\\), \\(I(d)\\)\n\n\n\nWe say that a time series is integrated of order d if the \\(d^{th}\\) difference of \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is a white noise process \\(\\{w_t\\}\\). Expressed differently, we write this as \\({\\nabla^d x_t = w_t}\\). We denote an integrated time series of order \\(d\\) as \\(I(d)\\).\n\n\nRecall that \\(\\nabla^d \\equiv \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right)^d\\). So, either of the following can be used to indicate an integrated time series of order \\(d\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\nabla^d x_t &= w_t \\\\\n  ~\\\\\n  \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right)^d x_t &= w_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nSpecial Case: \\(I(1)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nWhat model is given by the special case \\(I(1)\\)? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond-Order Differencing and Lagged Differences\nA linear trend can be removed by first-order differencing. A curved trend can sometimes be eliminated by second order differencing.\nIn some cases, a lagged difference is more appropriate.

This is called parameter parsimony.\nIf \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) have a common factor, a stationary model can be simplified. This is called parameter redundancy. As an example, the model \\[\n  \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{B} \\right)\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathbf{B} \\right) x_t\n  =\n  \\left( 1-\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{B} \\right)\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\] is the same as the model \\[\n  \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\mathbf{B} \\right) x_t\n  =\n  \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of AR and MA Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF and PACF of an \\(AR(p)\\) Process\n\n\n\nWe can use the pacf and acf plots to assess if an \\(AR(p)\\) or \\(MA(q)\\) model is appropriate. For an \\(AR(p)\\) or \\(MA(q)\\) process, we observe the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAR(p)\nMA(q)\nARMA(p,q)\n\n\n\n\nACF\nTails off\nCuts off after lag \\(q\\)\nTails off\n\n\nPACF\nCuts off after lag \\(p\\)\nTails off\nTails off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Time Series with a Regular Seasonal Pattern\nHere are some steps you can use to guide your work as you analyze time series with a regular seasonal pattern. Even though these are presented linearly, you may find it helpful to iterate between some of the steps as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing a Time Series with a Regular Seasonal Pattern\n\n\n\n\nCreate a time plot of the series\nDetermine an appropriate model for the trend and seasonality; call this Model 1\n\nRegression\nHolt-Winters\nAdditive / Multiplicative Decomposition\nOther Techniques\n\nUse AIC/AICc/BIC (or other metrics) and your reasoning skills to choose the best model\nObtain the residuals\nCheck the residuals of Model 1 for evidence of autocorrelation and non-stationarity\n\nTime plot of the residuals\nACF plot\nPACF plot\n\nFit an AR/MA/ARMA model to the (stationary) residuals; call this Model 2\nCheck the residuals of Model 2 for evidence of autocorrelation and normality\n\nACF plot\nPACF plot\nHistogram\n\nForecast the trend and seasonality of the time series using Model 1\nForecast the residuals of Model 1 using Model 2\nAdd the two forecasts together\nPlot and summarize the resulting forecast\nRefine the models above as needed",

We can express this model as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\log(x_t) &= \\beta_0\n            + \\beta_1 \\left( \\frac{t - \\mu_t}{\\sigma_t} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            + \\beta_2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            + \\beta_4 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_5 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            + \\beta_6 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_7 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            + \\beta_8 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_9 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            + \\beta_{10} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_{11} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n            \\phantom{+ \\beta_{13} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right)}\n            + \\beta_{12} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right)\n      + z_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nShow the code\nfull_linear_lm &lt;- sim_ts |&gt;\n  model(full_linear = TSLM(log(x_t) ~ std_t + \n    sin1 + cos1 + sin2 + cos2 + sin3 + cos3 \n    + sin4 + cos4 + sin5 + cos5 + cos6 )) # Note sin6 is omitted\nfull_linear_lm |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  mutate(sig = p.value &lt; 0.05)\n\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 7\n   .model      term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value sig  \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 full_linear (Intercept)  2.82      0.00220  1281.    4.18e-203 TRUE \n 2 full_linear std_t        0.475     0.00222   214.    3.22e-129 TRUE \n 3 full_linear sin1         0.0326    0.00312    10.4   1.83e- 17 TRUE \n 4 full_linear cos1         0.0388    0.00311    12.5   9.93e- 22 TRUE \n 5 full_linear sin2         0.0496    0.00311    15.9   1.47e- 28 TRUE \n 6 full_linear cos2         0.0298    0.00311     9.56  1.41e- 15 TRUE \n 7 full_linear sin3         0.0110    0.00311     3.55  5.99e-  4 TRUE \n 8 full_linear cos3         0.00767   0.00311     2.47  1.54e-  2 TRUE \n 9 full_linear sin4         0.00153   0.00311     0.492 6.24e-  1 FALSE\n10 full_linear cos4         0.00188   0.00311     0.604 5.47e-  1 FALSE\n11 full_linear sin5         0.00168   0.00311     0.541 5.90e-  1 FALSE\n12 full_linear cos5         0.00189   0.00311     0.607 5.45e-  1 FALSE\n13 full_linear cos6         0.00186   0.00220     0.844 4.01e-  1 FALSE\n\n\n\n\nReduced Linear Trend: Model 1\nThis model excludes the terms that were not significant in the full model with a linear trend.\n\n\nShow the code\nreduced_linear_lm1 &lt;- sim_ts |&gt;\n  model(reduced_linear1 = TSLM(log(x_t) ~ std_t + \n    sin1 + cos1 + sin2 + cos2 + sin3 + cos3))\nreduced_linear_lm1 |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  mutate(sig = p.value &lt; 0.05)\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  .model          term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value sig  \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n1 reduced_linear1 (Intercept)  2.82      0.00217   1301.   2.91e-213 TRUE \n2 reduced_linear1 std_t        0.475     0.00219    217.   1.58e-135 TRUE \n3 reduced_linear1 sin1         0.0326    0.00307     10.6  4.53e- 18 TRUE \n4 reduced_linear1 cos1         0.0388    0.00306     12.7  1.63e- 22 TRUE \n5 reduced_linear1 sin2         0.0496    0.00307     16.2  1.18e- 29 TRUE \n6 reduced_linear1 cos2         0.0298    0.00306      9.71 4.25e- 16 TRUE \n7 reduced_linear1 sin3         0.0111    0.00306      3.61 4.86e-  4 TRUE \n8 reduced_linear1 cos3         0.00767   0.00306      2.50 1.39e-  2 TRUE \n\n\nAll of the terms are significant in this model.\n\n\nReduced Linear Trend: Model 2\nWe reduce the model to see if a more parsimonious model will suffice.

We compute the autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function of the residuals for both. If there is evidence of autocorrelation, we will use the GLS algorithm to fit the models, since it will take into account the autocorrelation in the terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocorrelation of the Random Component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating Autocorrelation of the Random Component\nRecall that if there is autocorrelation in the random component, the standard error of the parameter estimates tends to be underestimated. We can account for this autocorrelation using Generalized Least Squares, GLS, if needed.\n\nReduced Quadratic Trend: Model 1\nFigure 2 illustrates the ACF of the reduced model 1 with quadratic trend.\n\n\nShow the code\nresid_q1_ts &lt;- reduced_quadratic_lm1 |&gt;\n  residuals() \n\nacf(resid_q1_ts$.resid, plot=TRUE, lag.max = 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ACF of reduced model 1 with a quadratic trend\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the residual correlogram indicates a positive autocorrelation in the values. This suggests that the standard errors of the regression coefficients will be underestimated, which means that some predictors can appear to be statistically significant when they are not.\nFigure 3 illustrates the PACF of the reduced model 1 with quadratic trend.\n\n\nShow the code\npacf(resid_q1_ts$.resid, plot=TRUE, lag.max = 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PACF of reduced model 1 with a quadratic trend\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the first partial autocorrelation is statistically significant. The partial autocorrelation plot indicates that an \\(AR(1)\\) model could adequately model the random component of the logarithm of the time series. Recall that in Chapter 5, Lesson 1, we fitted a linear regression model using the value of the partial autocorrelation function for \\(k=1\\).

    "text": "Class Activity: Joys of Trigonometry (15 min)\nIn the previous lesson, we learned how to incorporate an indicator (or dummy) variable for each season in a period. If there are twelve months in a year, this requires having twelve parameters in the model. Given that many seasonal changes are gradual and can be modeled by a continuous function, we can use sines and cosines to approximate the seasonal variation. This can lead to a smaller number of parameters than is required for the indicator variable approach.\nConsider the sine wave with the following parameters:\n\n\\(A\\):\\(~~\\) the amplitude,\n\\(f\\):\\(~~~\\) the frequency or the number of cycles per sampling interval, and\n\\(\\phi\\):\\(~~~\\) the phase shift.\n\n\\[\n  A \\sin ( 2 \\pi f t + \\phi )\n\\]\nHere is an interactive plot of this function. Adjust the values of \\(A\\), \\(f\\), and \\(\\phi\\) to see their effect on the function.\n\n\nNotice that this sine function is not linear in the parameters \\(A\\) and \\(\\phi\\).\n\\[\n  A \\sin ( 2 \\pi f t + \\phi )\n\\]\nOne of the trigonometric sum and difference identities is:\n\\[\n  \\sin(\\theta + \\phi)\n    = \\cos(\\phi) \\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(\\phi) \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\nWe apply this to our sine function.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  A \\sin ( 2 \\pi f t + \\phi )\n    &= \\underbrace{A \\cos( \\phi )}_{\\alpha_s} \\cdot \\sin ( 2 \\pi f t ) + \\underbrace{A \\sin( \\phi )}_{\\alpha_c} \\cdot \\cos ( 2 \\pi f t ) \\\\\n    &= \\alpha_s \\cdot \\sin ( 2 \\pi f t ) + \\alpha_c \\cdot \\cos ( 2 \\pi f t )\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe have transformed this from something that is not linear in the parameters \\(A\\) and \\(\\phi\\) to an expression that is linear in the parameters \\(\\alpha_s\\) and \\(\\alpha_c\\).\nWe can denote the frequency of a sine function as \\(f = \\frac{i}{s}\\), where \\(s\\) is the number of seasons in a cycle and \\(i\\) is some integer.

So, the function \\(f(t)\\) can be approximated to any desired level of precision by truncating the series after a sufficient number of terms. For the purpose of this discussion, we will define “one term” as an expression of the form \\[\n  \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_i} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_i} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) \\right\\}\n\\]\n\n\nFitting a Seasonal Component\nThe Fourier series exists for any smooth (continuously differentiable) function. Note theoretically, this allows us to obtain the value of the function at any real value by using this series. However, for a discrete time series with \\(s\\) seasons, we only need to evaluate the function at a finite number of points: \\(t = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, s-1, s\\). For example, in the previous lesson, we used twelve indicator variables to pass through twelve points in a monthly seasonal component to a time series with annual cycles.\nIt turns out, that we only need six terms (which involves twelve coefficients) to fit monthly data with annual cycles. In general, we only need to obtain \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) terms of this sum to fit the seasonal values perfectly.\n\n\n\nTable 1: A few examples of seasonal patterns and the corresponding values of \\(s\\) and \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern\nNumber of Seasons, \\(s\\)\nMaximum terms in the sum, \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\n\n\n\nDays in a Week\n7\n3\n\n\nQuarters in a Year\n4\n2\n\n\nMonths in a Year\n12\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if \\(s\\) is even and \\(i=\\frac{s}{2}\\), \\[\n  \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) = \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot t}{s} \\right) = \\sin \\left( \\pi t \\right) = 0\n\\] for all integer values of \\(t\\). So, this term must be omitted from the model. If we try to include it in the model, the coefficient will be rediculously large, as R trys to make the product of something very close to 0 (the value from the sine function) and the coefficient multiply to some reasonably small number.\nThe method for fitting seaonal components using indicator variables does not assume any relationship between successive seasons. However, values observed in January are often highly correlated with values observed in February, etc. Fitting a seasonal component using terms in the Fourier Series can often yield a good approximation for the periodic cycles with only a few terms.\nFor a time series with \\(s\\) seasons per cycle, our additive model can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  x_t\n    &= m_t + s_t + z_t \\\\\n    &= m_t +\n        \\sum_{i=1}^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_i} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_i} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) \\right\\}\n      + z_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe term \\(m_t\\) can take a variety of forms, including:\n\nLinear: \\(~~~~~~~~~~~\\) \\(m_t = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t\\)\nQuadratic: \\(~~~~~~\\) \\(m_t = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2\\)\nExponential: \\(~~~\\) \\(m_t = \\alpha_0 e^{\\alpha_1 t}\\)\nAny other functional form\n\nThe term \\(z_t\\) is a (possibly autocorrelated) time series with mean zero.\nWe will now focus on the seasonal term, \\(s_t\\). The full seasonal term when considering 12 months in a year is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  s_t\n    &= \\sum_{i=1}^{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rfloor} \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_i} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_i} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{s} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_i} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_i} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi i t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &=~~~~ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_1} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_1} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 1 \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_2} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_2} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 2 \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_3} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 3 \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_4} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_4} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 4 \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_5} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 5 \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_6} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_6} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} & \\leftarrow i = 6 \\\\\n    &=~~~~ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_1} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_1} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\}  \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_2} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_2} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_3} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_4} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_4} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 4 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\alpha_{s_5} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right) + \\alpha_{c_5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n    &~~~~~+ \\left\\{ \\phantom{\\alpha_{s_6} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right) +}~~ \\alpha_{c_6} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right) \\right\\} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that \\(\\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right) = 0\\) for all integer values of \\(t\\), so we can omit the term \\(\\alpha_{s_6} \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 6 t}{12} \\right)\\).\nAs noted above, we can often use a relatively small subset of these terms to get a good approximation of the seasonal component.\n\n\nSimulation\nThe following simulation illustrates harmonic seasonal terms. The values S1, S2, S3, \\(\\ldots\\) represent the coefficients on the sine functions: \\(\\alpha_{s_1}, ~ \\alpha_{s_2}, ~ \\alpha_{s_3}, ~ \\ldots, ~ \\alpha_{s_6}\\).

To illustrate this, a simulation of n = 1000 realizations of the time series above was conducted.\nThe parameter estimates and their standard errors are summarized in the table below. The “Computed SE” is the standard error reported by the lm function in R.

This implies that the standard errors will be underestimated, and the confidence interval is inappropriately narrow.\nHere are the values of the autocorrelation function of the residuals:\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Autocorrelation function of the residuals for the global temperature time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1M\n2M\n3M\n4M\n5M\n6M\n7M\n8M\n9M\n10M\n\n\n\n\n0.706\n0.638\n0.5\n0.447\n0.375\n0.307\n0.254\n0.206\n0.12\n0.078\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autocorrelation for \\(k=1\\) is 0.706. We will use this value when we apply the Generalized Least Squares method in the next section.\nTo get an intuitive idea of why ordinary least squares underestimates the standard errors of the estimates, the positive autocorrelation of adjacent observations leads to a series of data that have an effective record length that is shorter than the number of observations. This happens because similar observations tend to be clumped together, and the overall variation is thereby understated.\n\n\nApplying Generalized Least Squares, GLS\nThe autocorrelation in the data make ordinary least squares estimation inappropriate. What caped superhero comes to our rescue? None other than Captain GLS – the indominable Generalized Least Squares algorithm!\nThis fitting procedure handles the autocorrelation by maximizing the likelihood of the data, taking into account the autocorrelation in the residuals. This leads to much more appropriate standard errors for the parameter estimates. We will pass the value of the acf at lag \\(k=1\\) into the regression function.\n\n# Load additional packages\npacman::p_load(tidymodels, multilevelmod,\n  nlme, broom.mixed)\n\ntemp_spec &lt;- linear_reg() |&gt;\n  set_engine(\"gls\", correlation = nlme::corAR1(0.706))\n\ntemp_gls &lt;- temp_spec |&gt;\n  fit(x ~ stats_time, data = global_ts)\n\ntidy(temp_gls) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    lower = estimate + qnorm(0.025) * std.error,\n    upper = estimate + qnorm(0.975) * std.error\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Parameter estimates for the Generalized Least Squares estimates of the fit for the global temperature time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nlower\nupper\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-9.1361773\n0.4547490\n-20.09059\n0\n-10.0274689\n-8.2448856\n\n\nstats_time\n0.0046599\n0.0002354\n19.79209\n0\n0.0041985\n0.0051214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we observed visually, there is evidence to suggest that there is a linear trend in the data.",

    "text": "Class Activity: Linear Models with Seasonal Variables (10 min)\nSome time series involve seasonal variables. In this section, we will address one way to include seasonality in a regression analysis of a time series. In the next lesson, we will explore another method.\n\nAdditive Seasonal Indicator Variables\nRecall the time series representing the monthly relative number of Google searches for the term “chocolate.” Here is a time plot of the data from 2021 to 2023. Month 1 is January 2021, month 13 is January 2022, and month 25 is January 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Time plot of a portion of the chocolate search data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe fit a regression line to these data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The regression line is superimposed on the chocolate search time series.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we draw a line that is parallel to the regression line (has the same slope) but has a Y-intercept of 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A line parallel to the regression line that passes through the origin is added to the chocolate search time plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each month, we find the average amount that the relative number of google seachers that month deviates from the orange line (that is parallel to the regression line and passes through the origin). So, the length of the green line is the same for every January, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Representation of a linear model with seasonal indicator variables for the chocolate search time series data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the bottom of the green arrow is on the orange line, the top of the green arrow is the estimate of the value of the time series for that month.\nWe will create a linear model that includes a constant term for each month. This constant monthly term is called a seasonal indicator variable. This name is derived from the fact that each variable indicates (either as 1 or 0) whether a given month is represented. For example, one of the seasonal indicator variables will represent January. It will be equal to 1 for any value of \\(t\\) representing an observation drawn in January and 0 otherwise. Indicator variables are also called dummy varaibles.\nThis additive model with seasonal indicator variables can be perceived similarly to other additive models with a seasonal component:\n\\[\n  x_t = m_t + s_t + z_t\n\\] where \\[\n  s_t =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      \\beta_1, & t ~\\text{falls in season}~ 1 \\\\\n      \\beta_2, & t ~\\text{falls in season}~ 2 \\\\\n      ⋮~~~~ & ~~~~~~~~~~~~⋮ \\\\\n      \\beta_s, & t ~\\text{falls in season}~ s\n    \\end{cases}\n\\] and \\(s\\) is the number of seasons in one cycle/period, and \\(n\\) is the number of observations, so \\(t = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\) and \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, s\\), and \\(z_t\\) is the residual error series, which can be autocorrelated.\nIt is important to note that \\(m_t\\) does not need to be a constant. It can be a linear trend: \\[\n  m_t = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t\n\\] or quadratic: \\[\n  m_t = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2\n\\] a polynomial of degree \\(p\\): \\[\n  m_t = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2 + \\cdots + \\alpha_p t^p\n\\] or any other function of \\(t\\).\nIf \\(s_t\\) has the same value for all corresponding seasons, then we can write the model as: \\[\n  x_t = m_t + \\beta_{1 + [(t-1) \\mod s]} + z_t\n\\]\nPutting this all together, if we have a time series that has a linear trend and monthly observations where \\(t=1\\) corresponds to January, then the model becomes: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  x_t\n    &= ~~~~ \\alpha_1 t + s_t + z_t \\\\\n    &=\n      \\begin{cases}\n        \\alpha_1 t + \\beta_1 + z_t, & t = 1, 13, 25, \\ldots ~~~~ ~~(January) \\\\\n        \\alpha_1 t + \\beta_2 + z_t, & t = 2, 14, 26, \\ldots ~~~~ ~~(February) \\\\\n        ~~~~~~~~⋮ & ~~~~~~~~~~~~⋮ \\\\\n        \\alpha_1 t + \\beta_{12} + z_t, & t = 12, 24, 36, \\ldots ~~~~ (December)\n      \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the model illustrated in Figure 7. The orange line represents the term \\(\\alpha_1 t\\) and the green arrows represent the values of \\(\\beta_1, ~ \\beta_2, ~ \\ldots, ~ \\beta_{12}\\).\nThe folded chunk of code below fits the model to the data and computes the estimated parameter values.\n\n\nShow the code\nchocolate_month &lt;- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/chocolate.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    dates = yearmonth(ym(Month)),\n    month = month(dates),\n    year = year(dates),\n    stats_time = year + (month - 1) / 12,\n    month_seq = 1:n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = factor(month)) |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = dates)\n\n# Fit regression model\nchocolate_lm &lt;- chocolate_month |&gt;\n  model(TSLM(chocolate ~ 0 + stats_time + month))\n\n# Estimated parameter values\nparam_est &lt;- chocolate_lm |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  pull(estimate)\n\n\nThe estimated value of \\(\\alpha_1\\) is 1.1316416.

    "text": "Class Activity: Fitting a Simulated \\(AR(1)\\) Model with Zero Mean (5 min)\nWe will demonstrate how AR models are fitted via simulation. We will fit two different \\(AR(1)\\) models and an \\(AR(2)\\) model. The advantage of using simulation is that we know how the time series was constructed. So, we know the model that was used and the actual values of the parameters in that model. We can then see how close our estimated parameter values are to the true values.\n\nSimulate an \\(AR(1)\\) Time Series\nIn this simulation, we first simulate data from the \\(AR(1)\\) model \\[\n  x_t = 0.75 ~ x_{t-1} + w_t\n\\] where \\(w_t\\) is a white noise process with variance 1.\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(123)\nn_rep &lt;- 1000\nalpha1 &lt;- 0.75\n\ndat_ts &lt;- tibble(w = rnorm(n_rep)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    index = 1:n(),\n    x = purrr::accumulate2(\n      lag(w), w, \n      \\(acc, nxt, w) alpha1 * acc + w,\n      .init = 0)[-1]) |&gt;\n  tsibble::as_tsibble(index = index)\n\ndat_ts |&gt; \n  autoplot(.vars = x) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Time\",\n      y = \"Simulated Time Series\",\n      title = \"Simulated Values from an AR(1) Process\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R command mean(dat_ts$x) gives the mean of the \\(x_t\\) values as 0.067.\n\n\nFit an \\(AR(1)\\) Model with Zero Mean\n\n\nShow the code\n# Fit the AR(1) model\nfit_ar &lt;- dat_ts |&gt;\n  model(AR(x ~ order(1)))\ntidy(fit_ar)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .model           term  estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AR(x ~ order(1)) ar1      0.720    0.0220      32.8 2.07e-160\n\n\nThe estimate of the parameter \\(\\alpha_1\\) (i.e. the fitted value of the parameter \\(\\alpha_1\\)) is \\(\\hat \\alpha_1 = 0.72\\).\nWhen R fits an AR model, the mean of the time series is subtracted from the data before the parameter values are estimated. If R detects that the mean of the time series is not significantly different from zero, it is omitted from the output.\nBecause the mean is subtracted from the time series before the parameter values are estimated, R is using the model \\[\n  z_t = \\alpha_1 ~ z_{t-1} + w_t\n\\] where \\(z_t = x_t - \\mu\\) and \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nAnswer the following questions with your partner.\n\nUse the expression for \\(z_t\\) above to solve for \\(x_t\\) in terms of \\(x_{t-1}\\), \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\alpha_1\\), and \\(w_t\\).\nWhat does your model reduce to when \\(\\mu = 0\\)?\nExplain to your partner why this correctly models a time series with mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\nWe replace the parameter \\(\\mu\\) with its estimator \\(\\hat \\mu = \\bar x\\). We also replace \\(\\alpha_1\\) with the fitted value from the output \\(\\hat \\alpha_1\\). This gives us the fitted model: \\[\n  \\hat x_t = \\bar x + \\hat \\alpha_1 ~ (x_{t-1} - \\bar x)\n\\]\nThe fitted model can be expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\hat x_t\n    &= 0.067 + 0.72 \\left( x_{t-1} - 0.067 \\right) \\\\\n    &= 0.067 - 0.72 ~ (0.067) + 0.72 ~ \\left( x_{t-1} \\right) \\\\\n    &= 0.019 + 0.72 ~ x_{t-1}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nEven though R does not report the parameter for the mean of the process, \\(\\hat \\mu = 0.019\\), it is not significantly different from zero. One could argue that we should not use a model that contains the mean and instead focus on a simple fitted model that has only one parameter:\n\\[\n  \\hat x_t = 0.72 ~ x_{t-1}\n\\]\n\n\nConfidence Interval for the Model Parameter\nThe P-value given above tests the hypothesis that \\(\\alpha_1=0\\). This is not helpful in this context. We are interested in the plausible values for \\(\\alpha_1\\), not whether or not it is different from zero. For this reason, we consider a confidence interval and disregard the P-value.\nWe can compute an approximate 95% confidence interval for \\(\\alpha_1\\) as: \\[\n  \\left(\n    \\hat \\alpha_1 - 2 \\cdot SE_{\\hat \\alpha_1}\n    , ~\n    \\hat \\alpha_1 + 2 \\cdot SE_{\\hat \\alpha_1}\n  \\right)\n\\] where \\(\\hat \\alpha_1\\) is our parameter estimate and \\(SE_{\\hat \\alpha_1}\\) is the standard error of the estimate. Both of these values are given in the R output.\n\n\nShow the code\nci_summary &lt;- tidy(fit_ar) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        lower = estimate - 2 * std.error,\n        upper = estimate + 2 * std.error\n    )\n\n\nSo, our 95% confidence interval for \\(\\alpha_1\\) is: \\[\n  \\left(\n  0.72 - 2 \\cdot 0.022\n  , ~\n  0.72 + 2 \\cdot 0.022\n  \\right)\n\\] or \\[\n  \\left(\n  0.676\n  , ~\n  0.764\n  \\right)\n\\] Note that the confidence interval contains \\(\\alpha_1 = 0.75\\), the value of the parameter we used in our simulation. The process of estimating the parameter worked well. In practice, we will not know the value of \\(\\alpha_1\\), but the confidence interval gives us a reasonable estimate of the value.\n\n\nResiduals\nFor an \\(AR(1)\\) model where the mean of the time series is not statistically significantly different from 0, the residuals are computed as \\[\\begin{align*}\n  r_t\n    &= x_t - \\hat x_t \\\\\n    &= x_t - \\left[ 0.72 ~ x_{t-1} \\right]\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can easily obtain these residual values in R:\nThe variance of the residuals is \\(0.982\\). This is very close to the actual value used in the simulation: \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\).",

Thus the fitted AR(4) model (Equation (4.24)) provides a good fit to the data. As the AR model has no deterministic trend component, the trends in the data can be explained by serial correlation and random variation, implying that it is possible that these trends are stochastic (or could arise from a purely stochastic process). Again we emphasise that this does not imply that there is no underlying reason for the trends. If a valid scientific explanation is known, such as a link with the increased use of fossil fuels, then this information would clearly need to be included in any future forecasts of the series.”\n\nWhat is the author saying?\nHow would you respond to this statement?\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of the forecasted values for the next 100 years, based on the textbook’s model:\n\n\nShow the code\n# global_ar_book &lt;- global_ts |&gt;\n#   model(AR(x ~ order(4)))\ntemps_forecast_book &lt;- global_ar_book |&gt; forecast(h = \"100 years\")\ntemps_forecast_book |&gt;\n  autoplot(global_ts, level = 95) +\n#   geom_line(aes(y = .mean, color = \"Fitted\"),\n#     data = augment(global_ar_book)) +\n#   scale_color_discrete(name = \"\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Year\",\n      y = \"Temperature Change (Celsius)\",\n      title = paste0(\"Change in Mean Annual Global Temperature (\", min(temps_ts$year), \"-\", max(temps_ts$year), \")\"),\n      subtitle = \"100-Year Forecast Based on the Book's AR(4) Model\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast the results you observed in the two global temperature time series.\nWhat conclusions do you draw?",

State the fitted \\(AR(p)\\) model in the form \\[\\hat x_t = \\cdots\\]\n\nSolution:\n\n\nShow the code\nglobal_ar &lt;- temps_ts |&gt;\n    model(AR(change ~ order(3)))\ntidy(global_ar)\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  .model                term  estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AR(change ~ order(3)) ar1     0.737     0.0823     8.95  1.80e-15\n2 AR(change ~ order(3)) ar2    -0.0350    0.103     -0.339 7.35e- 1\n3 AR(change ~ order(3)) ar3     0.319     0.0839     3.80  2.15e- 4\n\n\nNote that the constant term is not statistically significant. If we ignore this term, we get the fitted model:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\hat x_t\n  &=\n    0\n    + \\hat \\alpha_1 ~ x_{t-1}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_2 ~ x_{t-2}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_3 ~ x_{t-3}\n    \\\\\n  &=\n    0.737\n    ~ x_{t-1}\n    +\n    (-0.035)\n    ~ x_{t-2}\n    +\n    0.319\n    ~ x_{t-3}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf we want to incorporate the constant term in the model, then we need to find the mean of the time series. The mean of the time series is:\n\nmean(temps_ts$change)\n\n[1] 0.06923611\n\n\nThe fitted AR model is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\hat x_t\n  &=\n    \\hat \\mu\n    + \\hat \\alpha_1 ~ (x_{t-1} - \\mu)\n    + \\hat \\alpha_2 ~ (x_{t-2} - \\mu)\n    + \\hat \\alpha_3 ~ (x_{t-3} - \\mu)\n    \\\\\n  &=\n    \\underbrace{\n    \\hat \\mu - \\hat \\alpha_1 (\\hat \\mu) - \\hat \\alpha_2 (\\hat \\mu) - \\hat \\alpha_3 (\\hat \\mu)\n    }_{\\hat \\alpha_0}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_1 ~ x_{t-1}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_2 ~ x_{t-2}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_3 ~ x_{t-3}\n    \\\\\n  &=\n    \\hat \\alpha_0\n    + \\hat \\alpha_1 ~ x_{t-1}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_2 ~ x_{t-2}\n    + \\hat \\alpha_3 ~ x_{t-3}\n\\end{align*}\\] Or, after substituting the fitted values: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\hat x_t\n  &=\n    0.069\n    +\n    0.737\n    ~ ( x_{t-1} - 0.069)\n    +\n    (-0.035)\n    ~ ( x_{t-2} - 0.069)\n    +\n    0.319\n    ~ ( x_{t-3} - 0.069) \\\\\n  &=\n    -0.0014\n    +\n    0.737\n    ~ x_{t-1}\n    +\n    (-0.035)\n    ~ x_{t-2}\n    +\n    0.319\n    ~ x_{t-3}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nObtain 95% confidence intervals for each of the parameters.

    "text": "Introduction to the Holt-Winters Method–Additive Model (35 min)\nWe will describe the historical progression that led to the Holt-Winters method.\n\nReview: Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) or Simple Exponential Smoothing\nThe exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) is a simple method for smoothing (or filtering) a time series. The update equation for the estimate of the level of the time series is\n\\[\n  a_t = \\alpha x_t + (1-\\alpha) a_{t-1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_t\\) is the estimate of the level of the time series at time \\(t\\) and \\(0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1\\) is the smoothing paramter.\nThis is known as the level update equation, because at each time step, we can update our estimate of the level (or the center) of the time series. It is called exponential smoothing, because at each preceding value has exponentially decreasing influence on the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nExplain the level update equation to your partner.\n\n\n\nThese computations are based on previous values and \\(a_1 = x_1\\). The number \\(0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1\\) is a smoothing parameter. This determines how much weight is given to previous values when creating the updated level estimate.\nIf you were to use this model for forecasting, you would not be able to consider any trend or seasonality in the forecast. Hence, the future values would all be forecasted as the last value of \\(a_n\\):\n\\[\n  \\hat x_{n+k|n} = a_n\n\\] where \\(\\hat x_{n+k \\mid n}\\) is the estimate of the time series \\(k\\) time units in the future past time \\(t=n\\). Frankly, this is not very useful, because many time series have trends or seasonality.\n\n\nHolt’s Exponential Smoothing\nIn 1957, Charles Holt published a new procedure that introduced a trend into this model. The forecasted values were:\n\\[\n  \\hat x_{n+k|n} = a_n + k b_n\n\\]\nwhere \\(b_n\\) is the slope indicating how much the time series changes on average from one time point to another and \\(k\\) is the number of time periods past \\(t=n\\) you are forecasting.\nThis method uses the same level update equation as EMWA. The slope update equation is:\n\\[\n  b_t = \\beta \\left( a_t - a_{t-1} \\right) + (1-\\beta) b_{t-1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(0 \\le \\beta \\le 1\\) is a smoothing parameter, \\(b_t\\) is the slope estimate at time \\(t\\), and \\(a_t\\) is the estimate of the level of the time series at time \\(t\\).\n\n\nHolt-Winters Filtering (Winters’ Exponential Smoothing)\nPeter Winters, a colleague of Holt’s at the Carnagie Institute of Technology, published an enhancement of Winters’ technique in 1960 that allowed for seasonal variation. This is known as the Holt-Winters Method or Holt-Winters Filtering.\n\nForecast Equation\nThe forecast equation is:\n\\[\n  \\hat x_{n+k|n} = a_n + k b_n + s_{n+k-p}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat x_{n+k|n}\\) is the forecasted value of the time series \\(k\\) units in the future after time \\(t=n\\), and the time series is assumed to have seasonality with a period of \\(p\\) time units; \\(a_n\\) is the level of the time series at time \\(t=n\\); \\(b_n\\) is the slope of the time series at time \\(t=n\\); and \\(s_{n+k-p}\\) is the estimated seasonal component at time \\(t=n+k-p\\). Note that we must look back one full period to get the estimated seasonal component.\n\n\nUpdate Equations\nThere are three update equations, one each for \\(a_t\\) (level), \\(b_t\\) (slope), and \\(s_t\\) (seasonal component).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  a_t &= \\alpha \\left( x_t - s_{t-p} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) \\left( a_{t-1} + b_{t-1} \\right) && \\text{Level} \\\\\n  b_t &= \\beta \\left( a_t - a_{t-1} \\right) + (1-\\beta) b_{t-1} && \\text{Slope} \\\\\n  s_t &= \\gamma \\left( x_t - a_t \\right) + (1-\\gamma) s_{t-p} && \\text{Seasonal}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is a time series from \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=n\\) that has seasonality with a period of \\(p\\) time units; at time \\(t\\), \\(a_t\\) is the estimated level of the time series, \\(b_t\\) is the estimated slope, and \\(s_t\\) is the estimated seasonal component; and \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are parameters (all between 0 and 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nWork with your partner to answer the following questions about the update equations.\n\\[\na_t = \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\left( x_t - s_{t-p} \\right) }_{A} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot  \\underbrace{ \\left( a_{t-1} + b_{t-1} \\right) }_{B}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\text{Level}\n\\]\n\nInterpret the term \\(A = x_t - s_{t-p}\\).\nInterpret the term \\(B = a_{t-1} - b_{t-1}\\).\nExplain why this expression for \\(a_t\\) estimates the level of the time series at time \\(t\\).\n\n\\[\nb_t = \\beta \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\left( a_t - a_{t-1} \\right) }_{C} + (1-\\beta) \\cdot \\underbrace{ b_{t-1} }_{D}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\text{Slope}\n\\]\n\nInterpret the term \\(C = a_t - a_{t-1}\\).\nInterpret the term \\(D = b_{t-1}\\).\nExplain why this expression for \\(b_t\\) estimates the slope of the time series at time \\(t\\).\n\n\\[\ns_t = \\gamma \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\left( x_t - a_t \\right) }_{E} + (1-\\gamma) \\cdot \\underbrace{ s_{t-p} }_{F}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\text{Seasonal}\n\\]\n\nInterpret the term \\(E = x_t - a_t\\).\nInterpret the term \\(F = s_{t-p}\\).\nExplain why this expression for \\(s_t\\) estimates the seasonal component of the time series at time \\(t\\).\nWhen the seasonal component appears on the right-hand side of the update equations, it always given as \\(s_{t-p}\\). Why do we use the estimate of the seasonal effect \\(p\\) periods ago? Why not apply a more recent value?\nWhat do the following sets of terms have in common?\n\n\\(\\{A, C, E \\}\\)\n\\(\\{B, D, F \\}\\)\n\nExplain why the Holt-Winters method works.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Estimates of \\(a_t\\), \\(b_t\\), and \\(s_t\\)\nWe can use the update equations to compute the next value of \\(a_t\\), \\(b_t\\), and \\(s_t\\), once we get going. Yet, how do we get started? What are the initial values of these estimates?\n\nEstimating \\(a_1\\):\nIt is reasonable to let \\(a_1 = x_t\\). We simply start our estimate of the level of the time series at the initial data value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nExplain why it is reasonable to let \\(a_1 = x_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating \\(b_1\\):\nFor the value of \\(b_1\\), the Cowpertwait textbook vaguely suggests estimating this from the data or setting it to zero. Setting \\(b_1\\) to zero is problematic, because it adversely affects the level and slope estimates at the beginning of the time series. We need a better way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the quantity \\[\n  \\dfrac{x_{p+1} - x_{1}}{p}\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe will approximate \\(b_1\\) by averaging the slope between pairs of points one period apart. Recall that \\(p\\) is the number of observations per period. (Monthly data which have an annual cycle would have \\(p=12\\). Daily data with a weekly cycle have \\(p=7\\).) Note that the fraction in the “Check Your Understanding” box above is an estimate of the slope of the time series as it moves from time \\(1\\) to time \\(p+1\\). These are the first observations in the first two cycles. We compute these estimated slopes for all the paired observations in the first two cycles, then we compute the mean of these slopes. This is reflected in the expression for \\(b_1\\):\n\\[\n  b_1 =\n    \\frac{\n      \\left(\n        \\dfrac{x_{p+1} - x_{1}}{p} +\n        \\dfrac{x_{p+2} - x_{2}}{p} +\n        \\dfrac{x_{p+3} - x_{3}}{p} +\n        \\cdots +\n        \\dfrac{x_{2p-1} - x_{p-1}}{p} +\n        \\dfrac{x_{2p} - x_{p}}{p}\n      \\right)\n    }{p}\n\\]\n\n\nEstimating \\(s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_p\\):\nThe initial \\(p\\) values of the seasonal effects, \\(s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_p\\), can be determined either by estimating based on the data or your prior experience; alternatively, they could be set to 0. For \\(t=1, 2, 3, \\ldots, p\\) iterations, use your estimate for \\(s_t\\) when the formulas call for \\(s_{t-p}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the term \\[\n  \\dfrac{x_{p+1} - x_{1}}{p}\n\\] estimate?\nWhy does the average of the values \\[\n  \\left\\{\n      \\dfrac{x_{p+1} - x_{1}}{p}, ~\n      \\dfrac{x_{p+2} - x_{2}}{p}, ~\n      \\dfrac{x_{p+3} - x_{3}}{p}, ~\n      \\cdots, ~\n      \\dfrac{x_{2p-1} - x_{p-1}}{p}, ~\n      \\dfrac{x_{2p} - x_{p}}{p}\n  \\right\\}\n\\] give a good estimate of the slope at the beginning of the time series?\nSuppose you needed to estimate \\(s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_p\\) for monthly sales data, where sales are highest in the summer months and lowest in the winter months. If January corresponds to month 1, which values of \\(s_t\\) would you set to be positive? negative? near zero?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo implement the initial seasonality estimates, we include them in the model as \\[\n  s_{1-p}, ~ s_{2-p}, ~ s_{3-p}, ~ \\ldots, ~ s_{p-p}\n\\] This allows us to begin using the data to update the \\(s_p\\) values in the first cycle of seasonality (\\(t = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, p\\)).",

    "text": "Application of the Holt-Winters Method to a Sample Time Series (10 min)\nThe Holt-Winters method provides a way to model a time series in which we consider the time series in layers. first, there is the level (the smoothed \\(x_t\\) values from the time series) at time \\(t\\). We will denote the level by \\(a_t\\). The level can change from time to time. We introduce a value \\(b_n\\), which we call the slope. This is the change in the level of the series from one time period to another. (As the book points out, R and many textbooks call the slope the trend.) Finally, we include a seasonal estimate, \\(s_t\\), which indicates how much the time series rises or falls above the level and trend values at time \\(t\\).\nTo visualize these terms, it can be helpful to consider the forecasting model. Suppose we have computed that Holt-Winters estimate of a time series with \\(n\\) observations. In other words, we have just fit a curve to the entire time series. We will use a very simple time series for this illustration.\nFirst, consider a time series that has a seasonal pattern of (100, 104, 100, 100) with zero trend and random components. This is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sample time series with zero trend and random components\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we add a slope of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to this time series. In Figure 2, we observe the same sample time series, but with the added component of a slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sample time series with a trend\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we apply the Holt-Winters method to these data.

The number of five-minute periods in a day is:\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\frac{60}{5}}_{\\substack{\\text{Number of} \\\\ \\text{5-minute periods} \\\\ \\text{per hour}}} \\cdot \\underbrace{24}_{\\substack{\\text{Number of} \\\\ \\text{hours} \\\\ \\text{per day}}} = ~~ 288~~\\text{five-minute periods per day}\n\\]\nThat is, the time series will follow a cycle that repeats every 288 five-minute intervals.

Around what time of day are the speeds highest? When are the speeds lowest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the EWMA when there is a trend and/or seasonal variation\n\n\n\nOne assumption for the EWMA is that there is no trend or seasonal variation. If present, we need to eliminate the trend and seasonal variation before applying the EWMA algorithm. In this case, we decompose the time series and compute the EWMA for the random component. Finally, we add the trend and seasonal components back in to get the EWMA estimate for the time series.\n\n\nThese data demonstrate distinct seasonal variation. We will need to apply the EWMA algorithm to the random component and later add the seasonal component and trend to our EWMA estimate.\nWe demonstrate the computation of the EWMA for a few choices of \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nEWMA with \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\)EWMA with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)EWMA with \\(\\alpha = 0.2\\)EWMA with \\(\\alpha = 0.75\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Illustration of the computation of the EWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate-Time\nRandom $$ \\hat z_t $$\nComputation of $$ a_t $$\n$$a_t$$\n\n\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:00\n-18.258\n-18.258 =\n-18.258\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:05\n-17.597\n0.01 * (-17.597) + (1 - 0.01) * (-18.258) =\n-18.251\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:10\n-17.095\n0.01 * (-17.095) + (1 - 0.01) * (-18.251) =\n-18.24\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:15\n-16.342\n0.01 * (-16.342) + (1 - 0.01) * (-18.24) =\n-18.221\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:20\n-17.627\n0.01 * (-17.627) + (1 - 0.01) * (-18.221) =\n-18.215\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:25\n-14.03\n0.01 * (-14.03) + (1 - 0.01) * (-18.215) =\n-18.173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot showing the EWMA for the random component for all the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data time series\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of the EWMA against the random component for four hours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data for a four-hour period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Illustration of the computation of the EWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate-Time\nRandom $$ \\hat z_t $$\nComputation of $$ a_t $$\n$$a_t$$\n\n\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:00\n-18.258\n-18.258 =\n-18.258\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:05\n-17.597\n0.05 * (-17.597) + (1 - 0.05) * (-18.258) =\n-18.225\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:10\n-17.095\n0.05 * (-17.095) + (1 - 0.05) * (-18.225) =\n-18.168\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:15\n-16.342\n0.05 * (-16.342) + (1 - 0.05) * (-18.168) =\n-18.077\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:20\n-17.627\n0.05 * (-17.627) + (1 - 0.05) * (-18.077) =\n-18.054\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:25\n-14.03\n0.05 * (-14.03) + (1 - 0.05) * (-18.054) =\n-17.853\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot showing the EWMA for the random component for all the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data time series\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of the EWMA against the random component for four hours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data for a four-hour period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Illustration of the computation of the EWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate-Time\nRandom $$ \\hat z_t $$\nComputation of $$ a_t $$\n$$a_t$$\n\n\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:00\n-18.258\n-18.258 =\n-18.258\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:05\n-17.597\n0.2 * (-17.597) + (1 - 0.2) * (-18.258) =\n-18.126\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:10\n-17.095\n0.2 * (-17.095) + (1 - 0.2) * (-18.126) =\n-17.919\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:15\n-16.342\n0.2 * (-16.342) + (1 - 0.2) * (-17.919) =\n-17.604\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:20\n-17.627\n0.2 * (-17.627) + (1 - 0.2) * (-17.604) =\n-17.608\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:25\n-14.03\n0.2 * (-14.03) + (1 - 0.2) * (-17.608) =\n-16.893\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot showing the EWMA for the random component for all the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data time series\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of the EWMA against the random component for four hours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data for a four-hour period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Illustration of the computation of the EWMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate-Time\nRandom $$ \\hat z_t $$\nComputation of $$ a_t $$\n$$a_t$$\n\n\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:00\n-18.258\n-18.258 =\n-18.258\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:05\n-17.597\n0.75 * (-17.597) + (1 - 0.75) * (-18.258) =\n-17.762\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:10\n-17.095\n0.75 * (-17.095) + (1 - 0.75) * (-17.762) =\n-17.261\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:15\n-16.342\n0.75 * (-16.342) + (1 - 0.75) * (-17.261) =\n-16.572\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:20\n-17.627\n0.75 * (-17.627) + (1 - 0.75) * (-16.572) =\n-17.363\n\n\n7/2/2022 12:25\n-14.03\n0.75 * (-14.03) + (1 - 0.75) * (-17.363) =\n-14.864\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot showing the EWMA for the random component for all the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data time series\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot of the EWMA against the random component for four hours:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: EWMA superimposed on the random component of the traffic data for a four-hour period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have obtained the EWMA for the random component, we can add to it the trend and seasonality to get the EWMA for the original speed data.

When one time series leads another, we can sometimes use the one that leads to predict the one that lags–at least in the short term.\nThe sample cross-covariance function (ccvf) is defined as:\n\\[\n  c_k(x,y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n-k} \\left(x_{t+k} - \\bar x \\right) \\left( y_t - \\bar y \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the notation \\(x_{t+k}\\) mean?\nExplain the concept of the ccvf.\nCompare and contrast the ccvf to the acvf.\nDescribe the quantity \\(c_k(x,y)\\) to your partner.\n\nExplain every component of the expression.\nDiscuss how to compute each part.\nIn your own words, explain what the result means.\n\nGive the expression for the ccvf of a time series with itself, \\(c_k(x,x)\\).\n\nWhat is this function called?\n\nFind an expression for \\(c_0(x,x)\\).\n\nSelected Solutions\n\nWe can compute the ccvf of a time series with itself:\n\\[\n  c_k(x,x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} \\left( x_{t+k} - \\bar x \\right) \\left( x_t - \\bar x \\right)\n\\]\nIn particular, if \\(k=0\\), this reduces to:\n\\[\n  c_0(x,x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} \\left( x_{t} - \\bar x \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Cross-Correlation Function (ccf)\nWe define the sample cross-correlation function to help us identify when one variable leads another and by how many time periods. Note that \\(r_k\\), given in the book as Equation (3.5), is misidentified there as the sample acf.\n\\[\n  r_k(x,y) =\n    \\frac{\n        c_k(x,y)\n    }{\n        \\sqrt{ c_0(x,x) \\cdot c_0(y,y) }\n    }\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nWork with your assigned partner to do the following:\n\nDescribe the quantity \\(r_k(x,y)\\) to your partner.\n\nExplain every component of the expression.\nDiscuss how to compute each part.\nIn your own words, explain what the result means.\n\nWhat are the bounds on the values of \\(r_k\\)?",

    "text": "Hands-on Exercise – Exploring Sample Autocorrelation (40 min)\n\n\nComparison of Independent and Autocorrelated Error Terms\nIn the previous lesson, we computed the sample covariance and sample correlation coefficient between two independent variables. When working with time series, the observations are not independent. There is often a relationship between sequential observations. We will compute the autocovariance function and autocorrelation function for a time series. Note: the prefix “auto” comes from a Greek root meaning “self.”\nThe figure below illustrates the difference between a series of data, where the residuals are independent compared to a series with autocorrelated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nThe variances of the residuals for these two series are approximately equal. What characteristics distinguish the two series in the figure above?\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocovariance and Autocorrelation\nWe will use the following data to explore the concepts of autovariance and autocorrelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n$$ x_t $$\n\n\n\n\n1\n4.4\n\n\n2\n4.2\n\n\n3\n4.2\n\n\n4\n4.0\n\n\n5\n4.4\n\n\n6\n4.7\n\n\n7\n4.9\n\n\n8\n5.3\n\n\n9\n5.4\n\n\n10\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use this R command to read in the observations.\n\n\nx &lt;- c( 4.4, 4.2, 4.2, 4, 4.4, 4.7, 4.9, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the sample mean of these data repeatedly.

First, we start with a lag of 1. With a lag of 1 the corresponding values of the time series that are being compared are shifted by one time unit. Then, we will consider any integer lag: lag \\(k\\).\n\n\nLag \\(k\\) Sample Autocovariance Function (acvf), \\(c_k\\)\nThe lag \\(k\\) sample autocovariance function, acvf, denoted \\(c_k\\), is defined as\n\\[\n  c_k = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n-k}(x_t-\\bar x)(x_{t+k}-\\bar x)\n\\]\nWe denote the lag by the letter \\(k\\), where \\(k \\ge 0\\).

Recall that \\(\\bar x = 4.7\\).\nWith your partner, add up the values in the last column to verify that the sum is 2.06.\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below illustrates the relationship between the observed data (\\(x_t\\)) and the next observation (\\(x_{t+1}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the second variable is \\(x_{t+1}\\), where \\(t&gt;1\\). the autocovariance of \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_{t+1}\\) is:\n\\[\n  c_1\n    = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n-1}(x_t-\\bar x)(x_{t+1}-\\bar x)\n    = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{9}(x_t-\\bar x)(x_{t+1}-\\bar x)\n  = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 2.06\n  = 0.206\n\\]\nThis is the (auto)covariance of \\(x\\) with itself, but with a lag of 1 time unit.

We have already determined that \\(c_1 = 0.206\\). We now compute \\(c_0\\):\n\\[\n  c_0 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n-0} (x_t-\\bar x)(x_{t+0}-\\bar x)\n    = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{n} (x_t-\\bar x)^2\n    = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 2.7\n    = 0.27\n\\]\nWe use \\(c_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) to compute \\(r_1\\).

Unfortunately, obtaining the data for the entire population can be impractical or even impossible. This is where sample mean comes in.\n\n# Sample data\ndata &lt;- data.frame(val=rnorm(200, 1.37))  # Generate 20 random numbers from a normal distribution\n\n# Sample mean calculation\nsample_mean &lt;- mean(data$val)\n\n# Print the sample mean\ncat(\"Sample mean:\", sample_mean, \"\\n\")\n\nSample mean: 1.304522 \n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Explain the intuition of sample mean using a histogram\nA histogram helps visualize the distribution of the data points in your sample. The sample mean, by definition, tends to be concentrated around the center of this distribution. The more data points you have in your sample, the closer the sample mean gets to the true expected value.\n\n# Histogram with sample mean highlighted\nggplot(data, aes(x = val)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = \"lightblue\") +  # Adjust bin count as needed\n  labs(x = \"Data value\", y = \"Frequency\", title = \"Sample mean distribution\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", lwd = 2, label = \"Sample Mean\") +\n  theme_classic()  # Optional: adjust plot aesthetics\n\nWarning in geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean, color = \"red\", linetype =\n\"dashed\", : Ignoring unknown parameters: `label`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the histogram, you can see how the data points tend to cluster around the sample mean, providing an intuition for how it estimates the true expected value of the population.",

    "text": "Small Group Activity: Holt-Winters Model for Residential Natural Gas Consumption (35 min)\nThe United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes data on the total residential natural gas consumption in the country. This government agency publishes monthly data beginning in January 1973. For the purpose of this example, we will only consider quarterly values beginning in 2017. The data are given in MMcf (thousand-thousand cubic feet, or millions of cubic feet). We convert the data to billions of cubic feet (Bcf) and round to the nearest integer to make the numbers a little more manageable.\n\n\nShow the code\nnat_gas &lt;- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/natural_gas_res.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(date = my(month)) |&gt;\n  filter(date &gt;= my(\"Jan 2017\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(quarter = yearquarter(date)) |&gt;\n  group_by(quarter) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    gas_use_mmcf = sum(residential_nat_gas_consumption),\n    n = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(n == 3) |&gt;  # Eliminate partial quarter(s)\n  dplyr::select(-n) |&gt;\n  mutate(gas_billion_cf = round(gas_use_mmcf / 10^3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarter\ngas_use_mmcf\ngas_billion_cf\n\n\n\n\n2017 Q1\n1990316\n1990\n\n\n2017 Q2\n602515\n603\n\n\n2017 Q3\n325786\n326\n\n\n2017 Q4\n1494706\n1495\n\n\n2018 Q1\n2330552\n2331\n\n\n2018 Q2\n729111\n729\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n2022 Q2\n709645\n710\n\n\n2022 Q3\n327101\n327\n\n\n2022 Q4\n1590005\n1590\n\n\n2023 Q1\n2114999\n2115\n\n\n2023 Q2\n663003\n663\n\n\n2023 Q3\n328735\n329\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quarters are defined as:\n\nQuarter 1: Jan, Feb, Mar\nQuarter 2: Apr, May, Jun\nQuarter 3: Jul, Aug, Sep\nQuarter 4: Oct, Nov, Dec\n\nThe weather is colder in the first and fourth quarters, so the demand for natural gas will be higher then. As illustrated in Figure 1, the difference in the consumption in the lowest and highest quarters of a year tends to be about 2000 Bcf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quarterly U.S. natural gas consumption (Bcf)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use this information to create an initial estimate of the seasonality of the time series. We will assume that in Quarters 1 and 4, natural gas use is 1000 Bcf above the level of the time series and in Quarters 2 and 3, it is 1000 Bcf below the level of the time series. This is not accurate, but it gives us a reasonable starting point.\nThe portion of the time series we are using begins in the first quarter of 2017. So we will choose the initial values of \\(s_t\\) as: \\[\n  s_{Q1} = 1000, ~~~ s_{Q2} = -1000, ~~~ s_{Q3} = -1000, ~~~ s_{Q4} = 1000\n\\]\nWith \\(p=4\\) quarters in a year, we implement initial seasonality estimates in the Holt-Winters model as \\[\n  s_{1-p} = s_{(-3)} = 1000, ~~~ s_{2-p} = s_{(-2)} = -1000, ~~~ s_{3-p} = s_{(-1)} = -1000, ~~~ s_{4-p} = s_{0} = 1000\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Holt-Winters filter for the quarterly natural gas consumption in the U.S. in billions of cubic feet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$Quarter$$\n$$t$$\n$$x_t$$\n$$a_t$$\n$$b_t$$\n$$s_t$$\n$$\\hat x_t$$\n\n\n\n\n2016 Q1\n-3\n—\n—\n—\n1000\n—\n\n\n2016 Q2\n-2\n—\n—\n—\n-1000\n—\n\n\n2016 Q3\n-1\n—\n—\n—\n-1000\n—\n\n\n2016 Q4\n0\n—\n—\n—\n1000\n—\n\n\n2017 Q1\n1\n1990\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Q2\n2\n603\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Q3\n3\n326\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Q4\n4\n1495\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Q1\n5\n2331\n1508\n-58\n805\n2313\n\n\n2018 Q2\n6\n729\n1519\n-44\n-1012\n507\n\n\n2018 Q3\n7\n318\n1464\n-46\n-1110\n354\n\n\n2018 Q4\n8\n1620\n1301\n-69\n693\n1994\n\n\n2019 Q1\n9\n2451\n1315\n-52\n871\n2186\n\n\n2019 Q2\n10\n670\n1347\n-35\n-945\n402\n\n\n2019 Q3\n11\n323\n1336\n-30\n-1091\n245\n\n\n2019 Q4\n12\n1573\n1221\n-47\n625\n1846\n\n\n2020 Q1\n13\n2089\n1183\n-45\n878\n2061\n\n\n2020 Q2\n14\n751\n1250\n-23\n-856\n394\n\n\n2020 Q3\n15\n354\n1271\n-14\n-1056\n215\n\n\n2020 Q4\n16\n1481\n1177\n-30\n561\n1738\n\n\n2021 Q1\n17\n2345\n1211\n-17\n929\n2140\n\n\n2021 Q2\n18\n690\n1264\n-3\n-800\n464\n\n\n2021 Q3\n19\n338\n1288\n2\n-1035\n253\n\n\n2021 Q4\n20\n1344\n1189\n-18\n480\n1669\n\n\n2022 Q1\n21\n2337\n1218\n-9\n967\n2185\n\n\n2022 Q2\n22\n710\n1269\n3\n-752\n517\n\n\n2022 Q3\n23\n327\n1290\n7\n-1021\n269\n\n\n2022 Q4\n24\n1590\n1260\n0\n450\n\n\n\n2023 Q1\n25\n2115\n1238\n-4\n949\n\n\n\n2023 Q2\n26\n663\n1270\n3\n-723\n\n\n\n2023 Q3\n27\n329\n1288\n6\n-1021\n\n\n\n2023 Q4\n28\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2024 Q1\n29\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2024 Q2\n30\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2024 Q3\n31\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2024 Q4\n32\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2025 Q1\n33\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2025 Q2\n34\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2025 Q3\n35\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n2025 Q4\n36\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolt-Winters Update Equations (Additive Model)\n\n\n\nRecall the three Holt-Winters update equations for an additive model are:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  a_t &= \\alpha \\left( x_t - s_{t-p} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) \\left( a_{t-1} + b_{t-1} \\right) && \\text{Level} \\\\\n  b_t &= \\beta \\left( a_t - a_{t-1} \\right) + (1-\\beta) b_{t-1} && \\text{Slope} \\\\\n  s_t &= \\gamma \\left( x_t - a_t \\right) + (1-\\gamma) s_{t-p} && \\text{Seasonal}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is a time series from \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=n\\) that has seasonality with a period of \\(p\\) time units; at time \\(t\\), \\(a_t\\) is the estimated level of the time series, \\(b_t\\) is the estimated slope, and \\(s_t\\) is the estimated seasonal component; and \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are parameters (all between 0 and 1).\nThe forecasting equation is: \\[\n  \\hat x_{n+k|n} = a_n + k b_n + s_{n+k-p}\n\\]\nThe details of these computations are given in Chapter 3 Lesson 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nApply Holt-Winters filtering to these data.

    "text": "Class Activity: White Noise (15 min)\n\nDefinition\nIn this class, we are learning to investigate different types of time series. Up to this point, we have focused mostly on time series with distinct seasonal behavior. We will not focus on what are called stochastic processes or random processes, where there is not necessarily a seasonal component. We first focus on white noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nBased on your understanding from the reading, explain the concept of white noise to your partner.\nCan you give an example of a time series that would represent white noise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a Discrete White Noise (DWN) Process\n\n\n\nA time series \\(\\{w_t: t = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) is a discrete white noise (DWN) if the variables \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\) are independent and identically distributed with mean 0. The assumption that the variables are identically distributed implies that there is a common variance denoted \\(\\sigma\\). The assumption of independence means that the covariance (and correlation) between different variables will be zero: \\(cov(w_i, w_j) = 0\\) and \\(cor(w_i, w_j) = 0\\) if \\(i \\ne j\\).\nIf the variables are normally distributed, i.e. \\(w_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), the DWN is called a Gaussian white noise process. The normal distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution, after Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation\nThe following simulation illustrates a white noise time series.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice about this time series?\nWhat characteristics do you observe in the correlogram?\n\n\n\n\n\nType I Errors\nIn your introductory statistics course, you probably learned about Type I error. Here is a quick refresher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType I Errors\n\n\n\nSuppose we will conduct a hypothesis test with a level of significance equal to \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). If the null hypothesis is true, there is a probability of 0.05 that we will reject the null hypothesis. Due to sampling variation, we will reject a true null hypothesis 5% of the time. We refer to this as making a Type I Error.\n\n\nWhen we create a correlogram, we actually conduct one hypothesis test for each value of \\(k\\). With so many hypothesis tests, it is not surprising if some of them show a significant correlation due to chance alone. In this case, we tend to disregard correlations that are barely significant and inexplicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nDo the following with a partner:\n\nClick on the [Simulate!] button above to generate a new simulated realization of the DWN process.\nOut of the 20 autocorrelations represented in the correlogram, count the number that are statistically significant.\nRepeat Steps 1. and 2. ten times, so you will have displayed 200 autocorrelations.\n\n\nWhat percentage of your autocorrelations were statistically significant?\nCompare your results with other teams.\nWhat percentage of these would you expect to be statistically significant, assuming the true autocorrelations are all zero?\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing White Noise\nThe data in the file white_noise.parquet were generated by a Gaussian white noise process.\n\n\nShow the code\n# This code was used to create the white noise data file\n\n# Set random seed\nset.seed(10)\n\n# Specify means and standard deviation\nn &lt;- 2500                           # number of points\nwhite_noise_sigma &lt;- rnorm(1, 5, 1) # choose a random standard deviation\n\n# Simulate normal data\ndata.frame(x = rnorm(n, 0, white_noise_sigma)) |&gt;\n  rio::export(\"data/white_noise.parquet\")\n\n\n\n# White noise data\nwhite_noise_df &lt;- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/white_noise.parquet\")\n\nThe first 250 points in this time series are illustrated here:\n\n\nShow the code\nwhite_noise_df |&gt; \n  mutate(t = 1:nrow(white_noise_df)) |&gt;\n  head(250) |&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = x)) + \n    geom_line() +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Time\",\n      y = \"Values\",\n      title = \"First 250 Values of a Gaussian White Noise Time Series\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a histogram of the 2500 values from this DWN distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nwhite_noise_df |&gt;\n  mutate(density = dnorm(x, mean(white_noise_df$x), sd(white_noise_df$x))) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),\n        color = \"white\", fill = \"#56B4E9\", binwidth = 1) +\n    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = density)) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Values\",\n      y = \"Frequency\",\n      title = \"Histogram of Values from a Gaussian White Noise Process\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the values follow a normal distribution. This suggests the data are from a Gaussian white noise distribution.\n\n\nSecond-Order Properties of Discrete White Noise\nWhen we refer to the second-order properties of a time series, we are talking about its variance and covariance. The mean is a first-order property, the covariance is a second-order property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond-Order Properties of a Discrete White Noise Process\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\{w_t\\}_{t=1}^n\\) is a DWN time series, then the population has the following properties.\n\\[ \\mu_w = 0 \\] and \\[\n  cov(w_t, w_{t+k}) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      \\sigma^2, & k = 0 \\\\\n      0,        & k \\ne 0\n    \\end{cases}\n\\] The correlation function is therefore\n\\[\n  \\rho_k =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1, & k = 0 \\\\\n      0, & k \\ne 0\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nNote that the properties given above are theoretical properties of the population, not estimates computed using a sample. The sample autocorrelations will not equal zero, due to randomness inherent in sampling.\n\n\nFitting the White Noise Model\nTypically, a DWN series arises in the random component of another time series. If we have fully explained the level and seasonality in the time series, then the only component left is the random component, which would ideally follow a DWN process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying of a Discrete White Noise Process\n\n\n\nA DWN process will have the following properties:\n\nThere is a discrete observations.\nThe mean of the observations is zero.\nThe variance of the observations is finite.\nSuccessive observations are uncorrelated.\n\n\n\nSince the mean of a DWN time series is zero, the only parameter we need to fit is the variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nCompute the sample variance for the DWN data in the file white_noise.parquet.",

Hence, random walks are non-stationary. The variance is unbounded as \\(t\\) increases. That implies a random walk will not provide good predictions in the long term.\nNote that if \\(0 &lt; k \\ll t\\), then \\(\\rho_k \\approx 1\\). Because of this, a correlogram for a random walk will typically demonstrate positive autocorrelations that start near 1 and slowly decrease as \\(k\\) increases. This is exactly what we observed in the simulation above.",

The operator \\(\\nabla^2\\) generates a time series that is comprised of the differences between successive terms of the differenced time series. It is the difference of the differences, or the second difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nConsider the following time series, where \\(n=8\\):\n\n\\(x_{1} = 5\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{2} = 10\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{3} = 13\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{4} = 8\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{5} = 4\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{6} = 3\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{7} = 9\\),\\(~\\) \\(x_{8} = 2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the first differences, \\(\\nabla x_t\\)\nFind the second differences, \\(\\nabla^2 x_t\\).\nFill in the missing steps: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\nabla^2 x_8 &= (1-\\mathbf{B} )^2 x_8 \\\\\n  &= (1-\\mathbf{B} ) \\left[ (1-\\mathbf{B} ) x_8 \\right] \\\\\n  &  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ⋮ \\\\\n  &= (x_8-x_7)-(x_7-x_6)\n\\end{align*}\\] and check that this is equal to the last term in the sequence of second differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$t$$\n$$x_t$$\n$$\\nabla x_t$$\n$$\\nabla^2 x_t$$\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n\n\n\n\n2\n10\n\n\n\n\n3\n13\n\n\n\n\n4\n8\n\n\n\n\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\n6\n3\n\n\n\n\n7\n9\n\n\n\n\n8\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-Group Activity: Computing Differences\nThe difference operator can be helpful in identifying the functional underpinnings of a trend.

This suggests that a more sophisticated model might be necessary. Note that for \\(k&gt;1\\), the autocorrelations in the differences are not significant. So, a random walk might be a good model for the differences.\nWe can add an additional terms to the random walk model using the slope estimate from Holt-Winters. Assume the next term in the time series can be modeled as the previous term plus an estimated slope plus a white noise component. This gives us the first equation below. We will use the Holt-Winters update equation to estimate the slope. This is the second equation below.\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n~~~x_t     = x_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + w_t \\\\\n   b_{t-1} = \\beta \\left( x_{t-1} - x_{t-2} \\right) + (1-\\beta) b_{t-2}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWe can constrain the Holt-Winters parameters \\(\\alpha=1\\) and \\(\\gamma=0\\), and find the estimated value of \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\nShow the code\nz_model &lt;- z_ts |&gt;\n    model(Additive = ETS(xrate ~\n        trend(\"A\", alpha = 1) +\n        error(\"A\") + season(\"N\", gamma = 0),\n        opt_crit = \"amse\", nmse = 1)) \n\nz_model |&gt;\n  coef()\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  .model   term  estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Additive alpha   1     \n2 Additive beta    0.155 \n3 Additive gamma   0     \n4 Additive l[0]    2.91  \n5 Additive b[0]    0.0104\n\n\nNote: The value of beta obtained using the feasts model() statement is 0.155. This is slightly different than the value obtained using the base R HoltWinters() command: 0.167. This is likely due to differences in the implementation of the Holt-Winters model, including the initial conditions.\nThis leads to the system of equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n~~~x_t     = x_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + w_t \\\\\n   b_{t-1} = 0.155 \\left( x_{t-1} - x_{t-2} \\right) + 0.845 ~ b_{t-2}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nStart with the fitted system of equations \\[\n\\begin{cases}\n~~~x_t     = x_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + w_t \\\\\n   b_{t-1} = 0.155 \\left( x_{t-1} - x_{t-2} \\right) + 0.845 ~ b_{t-2}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Show that it can be written as \\[\n  \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B})^2 x_t = (1 - 0.845 \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\] by completing the following steps.\n\nWrite the system of equations in terms of the backward shift operator.\nSolve for the term \\(\\mathbf{B} b_t\\) in the first equation and substitute the resulting expression into the second equation.\nCombine like terms and simplify.\n\n\n\nWe will examine the residuals from the Holt-Winters model:\n\n\nShow the code\nz_hw &lt;- z_model |&gt;\n        residuals()\n\nACF(z_hw, .resid) |&gt;\n    autoplot() +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Correlogram of Residuals from Holt-Winters Filtering\"),\n      x = \"Date\",\n      y = \"ACF\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are no significant autocorrelations, so we conclude that the Holt-Winters model yields reasonable estimates of the time series.",

(This is why it is called an “autoregressive model.”) Hint: write the \\(AR(p)\\) model in more familiar terms, letting \\[y_i = x_t, ~~ x_1 = x_{t-1}, ~~ x_2 = x_{t-2}, ~~ \\ldots, ~~ x_p = x_{t-p}, ~~ \\epsilon_i = w_t, ~~ \\text{and} ~~ \\beta_j = \\alpha_j\\]\n\nSolution: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n    x_t &= \\alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \\alpha_2 x_{t-2} + \\alpha_3 x_{t-3} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{p-1} x_{t-(p-1)} + \\alpha_p x_{t-p} + w_t \\\\\n    y_i &= \\beta_1 x_{1i} ~+~ \\beta_2 x_{2i} ~+~ \\beta_3 x_{3i} ~+ \\cdots +~ \\beta_{p-1,i} x_{p-1,i} ~~~+~ \\beta_p x_{p,i} + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis is a multiple linear regression equation with zero intercept.\n\n\n\nExplain why the prediction at time \\(t\\) is given by \\[\n\\hat x_t = \\hat \\alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \\hat \\alpha_2 x_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\hat \\alpha_{p-1} x_{t-(p-1)} + \\hat \\alpha_p x_{t-p}\n\\]\n\nSolution:\nThe prediction at time \\(t\\) in a multiple regression setting would be: \\[\n    \\hat y_i = \\hat \\beta_1 x_{1i} ~~~+~ \\hat \\beta_2 x_{2i} ~+~ \\hat \\beta_3 x_{3i} ~~+ \\cdots +~~ \\hat \\beta_{p-1} x_{p-1,i} ~~+~ \\hat \\beta_p x_{p,i}\n\\] Translated to the \\(AR(p)\\) setting, this becomes: \\[\n    \\hat x_t = \\hat \\alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \\hat \\alpha_3 x_{t-2} + \\hat \\alpha_3 x_{t-3} + \\cdots + \\hat \\alpha_{p-1} x_{t-(p-1)} + \\hat \\alpha_p x_{t-p}\n\\]\n\n\n\nExplain why the model parameters (the \\(\\alpha\\)’s) can be estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared error terms: \\[\\sum_{t=1}^n \\left( \\hat w_t \\right)^2 = \\sum_{t=1}^n \\left( x_t - \\hat x_t \\right)^2\\]\n\nSolution:\nThis is exactly how the multiple linear regression coefficients are estimated…minimizing the sum of the squared error terms.\n\n\n\nWhat is the reason this is called an autoregressive model?\n\nSolution:\nThis is called an autoregressive model because we regress the current tern on the previous terms in the series.\n\n\n\nAbsolute Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding Solutions\n\n\n\nFind the absolute value of the following (complex) numbers:\n\n\\(|-3| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + 0^2} = 3\\)\n\\(|4i| = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (4)^2} = 4\\)\n\\(|-3+4i| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (4)^2} = 5\\)\n\\(\\left| - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} + \\dfrac{1}{4} i \\right| = \\sqrt{\\left( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{-3}}{4} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{16} + \\dfrac{1}{16}} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(\\left| \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} i \\right| = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} = 1\\)\n\\(|5-12i| = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (-12)^2} = 13\\)\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Characteristic Polynomial to Assess Stationarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding Solutions\n\n\n\nFor each of the following AR processes, do the following:\n\nWrite the AR process in terms of the backward shift operator.\nSolve the characteristic equation.\nDetermine if the AR process is stationary.\n\n\n\\(AR(1)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = x_{t-1} + w_t\n\\]\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\\(AR(1)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = \\frac{1}{3} x_{t-1} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[\\mathbf{B} = 3\\] This is a stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(2)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = - \\frac{1}{4} x_{t-1} + \\frac{1}{8} x_{t-2} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{8} \\left(\\mathbf{B}^2 - 2 \\mathbf{B} - 8 \\right) x_t = w_t \\] \\[B = -4, ~~~ B = 2\\] This is a stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(2)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = - \\frac{2}{3} x_{t-1} + \\frac{1}{3} x_{t-2} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\mathbf{B}^2 - 2 \\mathbf{B} - 3 \\right) x_t = w_t \\] \\[B = -1, ~~~ B = 3\\] This is a non-stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(2)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = -x_{t-1} - 2 x_{t-2} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ \\left(\\mathbf{B}^2 + 1/2 * \\mathbf{B} + 1/2 \\right) x_t = w_t \\] \\[ B = \\frac{1}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4} i \\] \\[ |B| = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{7}{16} i } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\le 1 \\] This is a non-stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(2)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = \\frac{3}{2} x_{t-1} - x_{t-2} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ \\left(\\mathbf{B}^2 - \\frac{3}{2} \\mathbf{B} + 1 \\right) x_t = w_t \\] \\[ B = \\frac{3}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4} i \\] \\[|B| = 1\\] This is a non-stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(2)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = 4 x_{t-2} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ \\left(1 - 4\\mathbf{B}^2 \\right) x_t = w_t \\] \\[B = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\] \\[|B| = \\frac{1}{2}\\] This is a non-stationary AR process.\n\n\n\n\\(AR(3)\\) process: \\[\nx_t = \\frac{2}{3} x_{t-1} + \\frac{1}{4} x_{t-2} - \\frac{1}{6} x_{t-3} + w_t\n\\]\n\nSolution:\n\\[ B = 2, ~ -2, ~ \\frac{3}{2} \\] This is a stationary AR process.",

First, compute the sine and cosine terms using the original time variable, then transform the time variable by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. (In other words, compute a \\(z\\)-score.)\nThe model is adjusted accordingly after fitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen the independent variable (the measure of time) is large, floating point errors in the computation of the regression coefficents can be substantial.\n\n\nWe will demonstrate standardizing the time variable below.\n\n\nComputing the standardized time variable\nOur time variable was a simple incremented value counting the months ranging from 1 (representing 1/2008) to 192 (representing 12/2023).\nWe standardize this variable by the transformation:\n\\[\nzTIME\n  = \\frac{t - \\bar t}{s_t}\n  = \\frac{t - 96.5}{55.57}\n\\]\nwhere the mean of the variable TIME is \\(\\bar t = 96.5\\), and the standard deviation is \\(s_t = 55.57\\).\n\nweather_df &lt;- weather_df |&gt;\n  mutate(zTIME = (TIME - mean(TIME)) / sd(TIME))\n\nNow, we fit the trend components of the models using zTIME instead of TIME. We will start by modeling a cubic trend term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCubic Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCubic Trend: Full Model\nVisually, we can identify a positive linear trend in the data. It is possible that there are higher-order properties of the trend. We will include a quadratic and cubic term in our search for a model.\nIn addition to modeling the trend, we need to include terms for the seasonal component. We start with a full model that includes all six of the the sine and cosine terms from the summation above.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Cubic model with standardized time variable\n\nfull_cubic_lm &lt;- weather_df |&gt;\n  model(full_cubic = TSLM(x ~ zTIME + I(zTIME^2) + I(zTIME^3) +\n    sin1 + cos1 + sin2 + cos2 + sin3 + cos3 \n    + sin4 + cos4 + sin5 + cos5 + cos6 ))\n\nfull_cubic_lm |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  mutate(sig = p.value &lt; 0.05) \n\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 7\n   .model     term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value sig  \n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 full_cubic (Intercept)  57.2        0.405   141.    7.11e-184 TRUE \n 2 full_cubic zTIME        -0.359      0.678    -0.529 5.98e-  1 FALSE\n 3 full_cubic I(zTIME^2)   -0.733      0.303    -2.42  1.67e-  2 TRUE \n 4 full_cubic I(zTIME^3)    0.586      0.348     1.68  9.41e-  2 FALSE\n 5 full_cubic sin1        -16.0        0.383   -41.8   1.23e- 93 TRUE \n 6 full_cubic cos1        -23.7        0.382   -62.1   4.30e-122 TRUE \n 7 full_cubic sin2          1.29       0.382     3.37  9.34e-  4 TRUE \n 8 full_cubic cos2         -2.87       0.382    -7.51  2.74e- 12 TRUE \n 9 full_cubic sin3         -0.819      0.382    -2.15  3.33e-  2 TRUE \n10 full_cubic cos3          0.608      0.382     1.59  1.13e-  1 FALSE\n11 full_cubic sin4          0.377      0.382     0.987 3.25e-  1 FALSE\n12 full_cubic cos4         -0.214      0.382    -0.561 5.76e-  1 FALSE\n13 full_cubic sin5         -0.0810     0.382    -0.212 8.32e-  1 FALSE\n14 full_cubic cos5         -0.0433     0.382    -0.113 9.10e-  1 FALSE\n15 full_cubic cos6         -0.567      0.270    -2.10  3.70e-  2 TRUE \n\n\nShow the code\nforecast_df &lt;- full_cubic_lm |&gt; forecast(weather_df, ) |&gt; as_tibble() |&gt; dplyr::select(zTIME, .mean) |&gt; rename(pred = .mean)\n\nweather_df |&gt;\n  left_join(forecast_df, by = \"zTIME\") |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = dates) |&gt;\n  autoplot(.vars = x) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"#F0E442\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = \"#56B4E9\", alpha = 0.75) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Month\",\n      y = \"Mean Daily High Temperature (Fahrenheit)\",\n      title = \"Time Plot of Mean Daily Rexburg High Temperature by Month\",\n      subtitle = paste0(\"(\", format(weather_df$dates %&gt;% head(1), \"%b %Y\"), endash, format(weather_df$dates %&gt;% tail(1), \"%b %Y\"), \")\")\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cubic term in the trend is not significant, but the quadratic term is.

Why might you do this? If the model is particularly interpretable or makes logical sense in the context of the physical situation, it is better than a model with a lower AIC that is not readily interpretable.\nYou may even choose to include terms that are not statistically significant, if you determine they are practically important. For example, if a quadratic term is significant, but the linear term is not, it is a good practice to include the linear term anyway.\nNotice that the linear models corresponding to the “Reduced Quadratic 1” and “Reduced Quadratic 5” models have AIC/AICc/BIC values that are not much larger than the minimum values. Given other external evidence related to global warming, it is unlikely that the second derivative of the function representing the Earth’s mean temperature is negative. In other words, it does not seem like the rate at which the earth is warming is decreasing. Even if there is a quadratic component to the trend, it is not visible to the eye in the time plot.\nFor these reasons, we will apply the “Reduced Linear 5” model. This model implies a linear trend in the mean temperature of the Earth. The BIC for this model is not much bigger than the BIC for the “Reduced Quadratic 5” model. This model is simpler than the “Reduced Quadratic 1,” “Reduced Quadratic 5,” and “Reduced Linear 1” models.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  x_t &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\left( \\frac{t - \\mu_t}{\\sigma_t} \\right)  \n            + \\beta_2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1 t}{12} \\right) \\\\\n      & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + \\beta_4 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right)\n            + \\beta_5 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2 t}{12} \\right) + z_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fitting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fitting\nThe model we have chosen is the “Reduced Linear 5” model.

The data starts with the 1999 water year and goes through the 2023 water year.\nWe will average the flow rates across the first and last half of each month, so there are 24 values in a year. For various reasons, there are gaps in the data, even after averaging across the first and last half of the month. We impute the missing values by linear interpolation using the zoo package. This just means that when we encounter NAs, we fit a line between the most recent observed value and the next observed value. Then, we fill all the NAs in with the value given by the liner relationship between the two points.\nHere are a few of the values, after averaging:\n\n\nShow the code\n# load necessary packages\npacman::p_load(zoo) # for linear interpolation of missing values\n\n# create the tsibble\nfallriver_ts0 &lt;- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/fallriver.parquet\") |&gt;\n  mutate(date = ymd_hm(datetime)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(datetime, date, flow) |&gt;\n  mutate(dates = ymd(paste0(year(date), \"/\", month(date), \"/\", day(date)))) |&gt;\n  group_by(dates) |&gt;\n  summarize(flow = mean(flow), .groups = \"keep\") |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  as_tsibble(index = dates) |&gt;\n  fill_gaps() |&gt; \n  read.zoo() %&gt;% \n  # impute missing values by interpolation\n  na.approx(xout = seq(start(.), end(.), \"day\")) %&gt;% \n  fortify.zoo() |&gt;\n  rename(\n    flow = \".\", \n    dates = Index\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(round_day = ifelse(day(dates) &lt;= 15, 1, 16)) |&gt;\n  mutate(dates2 = ymd(paste0(year(dates), \"/\", month(dates), \"/\", round_day))) |&gt;\n  group_by(dates2) |&gt;\n  summarize(flow = mean(flow)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  rename(dates = dates2) |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = dates, regular = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndates\nflow\n\n\n\n\n1998-10-01\n634.682\n\n\n1998-10-16\n596.352\n\n\n1998-11-01\n578.583\n\n\n1998-11-16\n590.703\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n2023-08-01\n751.708\n\n\n2023-08-16\n634.236\n\n\n2023-09-01\n625.772\n\n\n2023-09-16\n584.168\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfallriver_ts &lt;- fallriver_ts0 |&gt;\n  # compute additional variables needed for the regression\n  mutate(TIME = 1:n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cos1 = cos(2 * pi * 1 * TIME / 24),\n    cos2 = cos(2 * pi * 2 * TIME / 24),\n    cos3 = cos(2 * pi * 3 * TIME / 24),\n    cos4 = cos(2 * pi * 4 * TIME / 24),\n    cos5 = cos(2 * pi * 5 * TIME / 24),\n    cos6 = cos(2 * pi * 6 * TIME / 24),\n    cos7 = cos(2 * pi * 7 * TIME / 24),\n    cos8 = cos(2 * pi * 8 * TIME / 24),\n    cos9 = cos(2 * pi * 9 * TIME / 24),\n    cos10 = cos(2 * pi * 10 * TIME / 24),\n    cos11 = cos(2 * pi * 11 * TIME / 24),\n    cos12 = cos(2 * pi * 12 * TIME / 24),\n    sin1 = sin(2 * pi * 1 * TIME / 24),\n    sin2 = sin(2 * pi * 2 * TIME / 24),\n    sin3 = sin(2 * pi * 3 * TIME / 24),\n    sin4 = sin(2 * pi * 4 * TIME / 24),\n    sin5 = sin(2 * pi * 5 * TIME / 24),\n    sin6 = sin(2 * pi * 6 * TIME / 24),\n    sin7 = sin(2 * pi * 7 * TIME / 24),\n    sin8 = sin(2 * pi * 8 * TIME / 24),\n    sin9 = sin(2 * pi * 9 * TIME / 24),\n    sin10 = sin(2 * pi * 10 * TIME / 24),\n    sin11 = sin(2 * pi * 11 * TIME / 24),\n    # sin12 = sin(2 * pi * 12 * TIME / 24) # zero for all integer values of t\n  ) \n\n# plot the time series\nfallriver_ts |&gt;\n  autoplot(.vars = flow) +\n  labs(\n      x = \"Date\",\n      y = \"Flow (cubic feet per second, cfs)\",\n      title = \"Fall River Flow Rate\",\n      subtitle = \"Above the Yellowstone Canal near Squirrel, Idaho\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\nUse the Fall River flow data to do the following.\n\nExplore various linear models for the flow of the Fall River over time.\nChoose a model to represent the data, and justify your decision.",

Unfortunately, this introduces bias in the forecasted means. This bias tends to be large if the regression model does not fit the data closely.\nThe textbook points out that the bias correction should only be applied for means, not for simulated values. This means that if you are simulating transformed values, and you apply the inverse of your original transformation, the resulting values are appropriate.\nWhen we apply the inverse transform to the residual series, we introduce a bias.  We can account for this bias applying one of two adjustments to our mean values. The theory behind this transformations is alluded to in the textbook, but is not essential.\nThere are two common patterns observed in the residual series: (1) Gaussian white noise or (2) Negatively-skewed values. Note that negatively-skewed values are the same as left-skewed values.\nWe can use the skewness statistic to assess the shape of the residual series. When the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, we say that the distribution is highly skewed. For skewness values between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, we say there is moderate skewness. If skewness lies between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is considered roughly symmetric.\n\n\n\n\nLog-Normal Correction\n\nNormally-Distributed Residual Series\nIf the residual series follows a normal distribution, we multiply the means of the forecasted values \\(\\hat x_t\\) by the factor \\(e^{\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2}\\):\n\\[\n  \\hat x_t' = e^{\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2} \\cdot \\hat x_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\left\\{ \\hat x_t: t = 1, \\ldots, n \\right\\}\\) gives the values of the forecasted series, and \\(\\left\\{ \\hat x_t': t = 1, \\ldots, n \\right\\}\\) is the adjusted forecasted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmperical Correction\n\nNegatively-Skewed Residual Series\nIf the residual series demonstrates negative skewness, then we can adjust the forecasts \\(\\left\\{ \\hat x_t \\right\\}\\) as follows:\n\\[\n  \\hat x_t' = e^{\\widehat{\\log x_t}} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{e^{z_t}}{n}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\left\\{ \\widehat{\\log x_t}: t = 1, \\ldots, n \\right\\}\\) is the forecasted series obtained by fitting the log-regression model.\n\\(\\left\\{ z_t \\right\\}\\) is the residual series from this fitted model in the log-transformed units.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code given below can be used to compute the corrected mean values for the simulated data.\n\n\nShow the code\nsim_model_values &lt;- sim_reduced_linear_lm1 |&gt;\n  glance()\n\nsim_model_check &lt;- sim_model_values |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    sigma = sqrt(sigma2),\n    lognorm_cf = exp((1/2) * sigma2),\n    empirical_cf = sim_reduced_linear_lm1 |&gt;\n      residuals() |&gt;\n      pull(.resid) |&gt;\n      exp() |&gt;\n      mean()) |&gt;\n  select(.model, r_squared, sigma2, sigma, lognorm_cf, empirical_cf)\n\nsim_pred &lt;- sim_reduced_linear_lm1 |&gt; \n  forecast(new_data = new_dat) |&gt;\n  mutate(.mean_correction = .mean * sim_model_check$empirical_cf) |&gt;\n  select(t, x_t, .mean, .mean_correction)\n\nsim_model_check\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .model              r_squared   sigma2  sigma lognorm_cf empirical_cf\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 sim_reduced_linear1     0.998 0.000507 0.0225       1.00         1.00\n\n\nFrom this, we observe that for the simulated data, \\(R^2 = 0.998\\). This indicates that the model explains a high proportion of the variation in the data. The log-normal adjustment is \\(1.00025\\), and the emperical adjustment is \\(1.00023\\). Both of these values are extremely close to 1, so they will have a negligible impact on the predicted values.\nThis result does not generalize. In other situations, there can be a substantial effect of this bias on the predicted means.\n\n\nHistogram of residuals\nFigure 3 gives a histogram of the residuals and compute the skewness of the residual series.\n\n\nShow the code\nsim_resid_df &lt;- sim_reduced_linear_lm1 |&gt; \n  residuals() |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(.resid) |&gt;\n  rename(x = .resid) \n  \nsim_resid_df |&gt;\n  mutate(density = dnorm(x, mean(sim_resid_df$x), sd(sim_resid_df$x))) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),\n        color = \"white\", fill = \"#56B4E9\", binwidth = 0.01) +\n    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = density)) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Values\",\n      y = \"Frequency\",\n      title = \"Histogram of Residuals from the Reduced Linear Model\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Histogram of the values in the residual series based on the model with a linear trend and seasonal Fourier terms where i≤3\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the command skewness(sim_resid_df$x) to compute the skewness of these residuals: -0.135. This number is close to zero (specifically between -0.5 and 0.5,) so we conclude that the residual series is approximately normally distributed. We can apply the log-normal correction to our mean forecast values.",

    "text": "Class Activity: Introduction to Moving Average (MA) Models (15 min)\n\nStationary Processes\nIn previous chapters, we have explored how to identify and remove the trend and seasonal components of a time series. After the trend and seasonal component have been properly removed, the residual should be stationary. However, these residual components may still contain autocorrelation.\nIn this chapter, we will explore stationary models that are appropriate when there are no obvious trends or seasonal elements. Combining the fitted stationary model with the estimated trend and seasonal components can improve our ability to make forecasts. We will build on the autoregressive (AR) models we learned in Chapter 4.\n\n\nStrictly Stationary Series\nFirst, we define a strictly stationary series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of Strict Stationarity\n\n\n\nA time series model \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is said to be strictly stationary if the joint distribution of the random variables \\(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \\ldots, x_{t_n}\\) is the same as the joint distribution of \\(x_{t_1+m}, x_{t_2+m}, \\ldots, x_{t_n+m}\\) for all \\(t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n\\) and \\(m\\), so that the distribution of the values in the time series is the same after an arbitrary time shift.\n\n\nIf a time series is strictly stationary, then its mean and variance are constant in time. Hence, the autocovariance \\(cov(x_t, x_s)\\) depends only on the lag, \\(k = | t - s |\\). We can therefore denote the covariance function as \\(\\gamma(k) = cov(x_t, x_{t+k})\\).\nNote: It is possible that a series could have a constant mean and variance in time and the autocovariance depends only on the lag, but the series is not strictly stationary. This is called second-order stationary.\nWe will focus on the second-order properties of the time series, even though all the series we will explore in this chapter are strictly stationary.\nNote: if a white noise process is Gaussian, the stochastic process is completely determined by the mean and covariance structure. This is similar to how a (univariate or multivariate) normal distribution is completely specified by the mean and variance-covariance matrix.\nThe concept of stationarity is a property of time series models. When we use certain models, we are assuming stationarity. Before we apply these models, it is important to check for stationarity in the time series. In other words, we check to see if there is evidence of a trend or seasonality and if so, we remove these components. We can use methods such as decomposition, Holt-Winters, or regression to remove the trend and seasonality. Hence, it is typically reasonable to consider the residual series as a stationary series. Typically the models in this chapter are applied to the residual series from a regression or similar analysis.\n\n\nMoving Average (MA) Models\nRecall in Chapter 4, Lesson 3, we learned the definition of an AR model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of an Autoregressive (AR) Model\n\n\n\nThe time series \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is an autoregressive process of order \\(p\\), denoted as \\(AR(p)\\), if \\[\n  x_t = \\alpha_1 x_{t-1} + \\alpha_2 x_{t-2} + \\alpha_3 x_{t-3} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{p-1} x_{t-(p-1)} + \\alpha_p x_{t-p} + w_t ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (4.15)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is white noise and the \\(\\alpha_i\\) are the model parameters with \\(\\alpha_p \\ne 0\\).\n\n\nThe \\(AR(p)\\) model can be expressed in terms of the backward shift operator: \\[\n   \\left( 1 - \\alpha_1 \\mathbf{B} - \\alpha_2 \\mathbf{B}^2 - \\cdots - \\alpha_p \\mathbf{B}^p \\right) x_t = w_t\n\\]\nNow, we consider a different, but related model, the moving average (MA) model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a Moving Average (MA) Model\n\n\n\nWe say that a time series \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) is a moving average process of order \\(q\\), denoted as \\(MA(q)\\), if each term in the time series is a linear combination of the current white noise term and the \\(q\\) most recent past white noise terms.\nIt is given as: \\[\n  x_t = w_t + \\beta_1 w_{t-1} + \\beta_2 w_{t-2} + \\beta_3 w_{t-3} + \\cdots + \\beta_{q-1} w_{t-(q-1)} + \\beta_q w_{t-q} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (6.1)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is white noise with zero mean and variance \\(\\sigma_w^2\\), and the \\(\\beta_i\\) are the model parameters with \\(\\beta_q \\ne 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n\n\n\nWrite Equation (6.1) in terms of the backward shift operator. Your answer will be of the form:\n\n\\[\n  x_t\n    = (\\text{some}~q^{th}~\\text{degree polynomial in}~\\mathbf{B}) w_t\n    = \\phi_q(\\mathbf{B}) w_t\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn \\(MA(q)\\) process is comprised of a finite summation of stationary white noise terms. Hence, an \\(MA(q)\\) process will be stationary with a time-invariante mean and autocovariance.\nThe mean and variance of \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) are easily derived. The mean must be zero, because each term is a sum of scaled white noise terms with mean zero.\nThe variance of an \\(MA(q)\\) process is \\({ \\sigma_w^2 \\left( 1 + \\beta_1^2 + \\beta_2^2 + \\beta_3^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_{q-1}^2 + \\beta_q^2 \\right) }\\). This can be seen, because the white noise terms are independent with the same variance.\nSo, the autocorrelation function is\n\\[\n  \\rho(k) =\n  cor(x_t, x_{t+k}) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1, & k=0 \\\\\n      ~\\\\\n      \\dfrac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{q-k} \\beta_i \\beta_{i+k} }{ \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^q \\beta_i^2 }, & k = 1, 2, \\ldots, q \\\\\n      ~\\\\\n      0, & k &gt; q\n    \\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\).\nNote that the autocorrelation function is zero if \\(k&gt;q\\), because \\(x_t\\) and \\(x_{t+k}\\) would be independent weighted summations of white noise processes and hence the covariance between them would be zero.\n\n\nWe now define an invertible \\(MA\\) process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of an Invertible \\(MA\\) Process\n\n\n\nAn \\(MA\\) process is said to be invertible if it can be expressed as a stationary autoregressive process (of infinite order) with no error term.\n\n\n\nExample of an Invertible MA Process\nRecall that \\[\n  (1-x)(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots) = 1\n\\]\nor,\n\\[\n  (1-x)^{-1} = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots)\n\\] if \\(|x|&lt;1\\).\nNow, note that the \\(MA\\) process\n\\[\n  x_t = \\left( 1 - \\beta \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\]\ncan be written as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\left( 1 - \\beta \\mathbf{B} \\right)^{-1} x_t &= w_t \\\\\n  \\left( 1 + \\beta \\mathbf{B} + \\beta^2 \\mathbf{B}^2 + \\beta^3 \\mathbf{B}^3 + \\cdots \\right) x_t &= w_t \\\\\n  x_t + \\beta x_{t-1} + \\beta^2 x_{t-2} + \\beta^3 x_{t-3} + \\cdots &= w_t \\\\\n  x_t &= \\left( -\\beta x_{t-1} - \\beta^2 x_{t-2} - \\beta^3 x_{t-3} - \\cdots \\right) + w_t\n\\end{align*}\\]\nassuming that \\(|\\beta|&lt;1\\). Note that this series will not converge unless \\(|\\beta|&lt;1\\).\nWe have just shown that the \\(MA\\) process \\[\n  x_t = \\left( 1 - \\beta \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\] is invertible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem: Invertibility of an \\(MA(q)\\) Process\n\n\n\nThe \\(MA(q)\\) process \\[\n  x_t = \\phi_q(\\mathbf{B}) w_t\n\\] will be invertible if the solutions to the equation \\[\n  \\phi_q(\\mathbf{B}) = 0\n\\] are all greater than 1 in absolute value.\n\n\nDoes this remind you of the test for the stationarity of an \\(AR(p)\\) model?\nNote that the autocovariance function (acvf) will identify a unique \\(MA(q)\\) process only if the process is invertible. Fortunately, the algorithm R uses to estimate an \\(MA(q)\\) process always leads to an invertible model.",

    "text": "Class Activity: Identifying AR and MA Models from the ACF and PACF (5 min)\n\nAR Process\nRecall that on page 81, the textbook states that in general, the partial autocorrelation at lag \\(k\\) is the \\(k^{th}\\) coefficient of a fitted \\(AR(k)\\) model. This implies that if the underlying process is \\(AR(p)\\), then all the coefficients \\(\\alpha_k\\) will equal 0 whenever \\(k&gt;p\\). So, an \\(AR(p)\\) process will result in partial correlations that are zero after lag \\(p\\). So, we can look at the correlogram of partial autocorrelations to determine the order of an appropriate \\(AR\\) process to model a time series.\n\n\nMA Process\nSimilarly, for an \\(MA(q)\\) process, the coefficients \\(\\beta_k\\) will equal 0 whenever \\(k &gt; q\\). Hence, an \\(MA(q)\\) process will demonstrate autocorrelations that are 0 after lag \\(q\\). So, considering the correlogram of autocorrelations, we can assess if an \\(MA(q)\\) model would be appropriate.\nBless their hearts, the textbook authors give a bad example in Section 6.4.2. They even state that it is “not a realistic realisation.” MA processes naturally arise in ratios of observed data. Multi-period asset returns (i.e. ratios of some previous term’s value) tend to follow an MA process.\nFor example, if there are 252 trading days in a year, then the daily series of year-over-year returns (this year’s value divided by last year’s value) follows an \\(MA(252-1)\\) process. If we are comparing values observed to those from one week ago, we would have an \\(MA(7-1)\\) process.\n\n\nComparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF and PACF of an \\(AR(p)\\) Process\n\n\n\nWe can use the pacf and acf plots to assess if an \\(AR(p)\\) or \\(MA(q)\\) model is appropriate. For an \\(AR(p)\\) or \\(MA(q)\\) process, we observe the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nAR(p)\nMA(q)\n\n\n\n\nACF\nTails off\nCuts off after lag \\(q\\)\n\n\nPACF\nCuts off after lag \\(p\\)\nTails off",

We call this model a Seasonal ARIMA model, or a SARIMA model. We use differencing at a lag equal to the number of seasons, \\(s\\). This allows us to remove additional seasonal effects that carry over from one cycle to another.\nRecall that if we use a difference of lag 1 to remove a linear trend, we introduce a moving average term. The same thing happens when we introduce a difference with lag \\(s\\). For the lag \\(s\\) values, we can apply an autoregressive (AR) component at lag \\(s\\) with \\(P\\) parameters, an integrated (I) component with parameter \\(D\\), and a moving average (MA) component with \\(Q\\) terms. This yields the full SARIMA model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of SARIMA Models\n\n\n\nA Seasonal ARIMA model, or SARIMA model with \\(s\\) seasons can be expressed as:\n\\[\n  \\Theta_P \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right) \\theta_p \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^s \\right)^D \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right)^d x_t = \\Phi_Q \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right) \\phi_q \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(p\\), \\(d\\), and \\(q\\) are the parameters for the \\(ARIMA(p, d, q)\\) model applied to the time series and the differences are taken with a lag of 1,\n\\(s\\) is the number of seasons, and\n\\(P\\), \\(D\\), and \\(Q\\) are the parameters for the \\(ARIMA(P, D, Q)\\) model applied to the time series where the differences are taken across a lag of \\(s\\).\n\n\\(\\Theta_P \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right)\\), \\(\\theta_p \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right)\\), \\(\\Phi_Q \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right)\\), and \\(\\phi_q \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right)\\) are polynomials of degree \\(P\\), \\(p\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(q\\), respectively.\nWe denote this model as \\(ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_s\\) or \\(ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[s]\\).\n\n\nLooking closely at this model, we can see it is the combination of the ARIMA model \\[\n  \\theta_p \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right)^d x_t = \\phi_q \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right) w_t\n\\] and the same model, after applying a difference across \\(s\\) seasons \\[\n  \\Theta_P \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right) \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^s \\right)^D x_t = \\Phi_Q \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right) w_t\n\\]\n\n\nSpecial Cases of a Seasonal ARIMA Model\n\nStationary SARIMA Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationarity of SARIMA Models\n\n\n\nThe SARIMA model is, in general, non-stationary. However, there is a special case in which it is stationary. An \\(ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_s\\) will be stationary if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nIf \\(D = d = 0\\), and\nThe roots of the characteristic equation \\[\n  \\Theta_P \\left( \\mathbf{B}^s \\right) \\theta_p \\left( \\mathbf{B} \\right) = 0\n\\] are all greter than 1 in absolute value.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Simple AR Model with a Seasonal Period of \\(s\\) Units\n\\(ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,0,0)_{s}\\) is given as\n\\[\n  x_t = \\alpha x_{t-s} + w_t\n\\] This model would be appropriate for data where there are \\(s\\) seasons and the value in the season exactly one cycle prior affects the current value. This model is stationary when \\(\\left| \\alpha^{1/s} \\right| &gt; 1\\).\n\n\nStochastic Trends with Seasonal Influences\nMany time series with stochastic trends also have seasonal influences. We can extend the previous model as:\n\\[\n  x_t = x_{t-1} + \\alpha x_{t-s} - \\alpha x_{t-(s+1)} + w_t\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to \\[\n  \\underbrace{\\left( 1 - \\alpha \\mathbf{B}^{12} \\right)}_{\\Theta_1 \\left( \\mathbf{B}^{12} \\right)} \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right) x_t = w_t\n\\]\nwhich is \\(ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)_s\\).\nNote that we could have written this model as: \\[\n  \\nabla x_t = \\alpha \\nabla x_{t-s} + w_t\n\\]\nThis makes it clear that under this model, the change at time \\(t\\) depends on the change at the corresponding time in the previous cycle.\nNote that \\(\\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right)\\) is a factor in the characteristic polynomial, so this model will be non-stationary.\n\n\nSimple Quarterly Seasonal Moving Average Model (with no Trend)\nWe can write a simple quarterly seasonal moving average model as\n\\[\n  x_t = \\underbrace{w_t - \\beta w_{t-4}}_{\\left( 1 - \\beta \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) w_t}\n\\]\nThis is an \\(ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,0,1)_4\\) model.\n\n\nQuarterly Seasonal Moving Average Model with a Stocastic Trend\nWe can add a stochastic trend to the previous model by including first-order differences:\n\\[\n  x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t - \\beta w_{t-4}\n\\] This is an \\(ARIMA(0,1,0)(0,0,1)_4\\) model.\n\n\nQuarterly Seasonal Moving Average Model where the Seasonal Terms Contain a Stocastic Trend\nWe can allow the seasonal components to include a stochastic trend. We apply differencing at the seasonal period. This yields the model\n\\[\n  x_t = x_{t-4} + w_t - \\beta w_{t-4}\n\\]\nThis is an \\(ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)_4\\) process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of Differencing\n\n\n\nRecall that lag \\(s\\) differencing will remove a linear trend, however if there is a linear trend, differencing at lag 1 will introduce an AR process in the residuals. If a linear model is appropriate in a, say, quarterly series with additive seasonals, then the model could be \\[\n  x_t = a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t\n\\]\nwhere \\([t]\\) is the modulus operator, or \\([t]\\) is the remainder when \\(t\\) is divided by \\(4\\). Another way to view this is to note that for a quarterly time series, \\([t] = [t-4]\\).\nIf we apply first-order differencing at lag 4, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) x_t\n    &= x_t - x_{t-4} \\\\\n    &= \\left(a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t \\right) - \\left(a + b(t-4) + s_{[t-4]} + w_{t-4} \\right) \\\\\n    &= \\left(a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t \\right) - \\left(a + b(t-4) + s_{[t]} + w_{t-4} \\right) \\\\\n    &= 4b + w_t - w_{t-4}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is an \\(ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)_4\\) process with constant term of \\(4b\\).\nIf we apply first-order differencing at lag 1 and then do the differencing at lag 4, we get the following process: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B} \\right) x_t\n    &= \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left( x_t  - \\mathbf{B}x_t \\right) \\\\\n    &= \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left[ \\left( a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t \\right)  - \\mathbf{B} \\left( a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t \\right) \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left[ \\left( a + bt + s_{[t]} + w_t \\right)  - \\left( a + b(t-1) + s_{[t-1]} + w_{t-1} \\right) \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left[ \\left( s_{[t]} + w_t \\right)  - \\left( -b + s_{[t-1]} + w_{t-1} \\right) \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\left( 1 - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\right) \\left( b + s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_t - w_{t-1} \\right) \\\\\n    &= \\left( b + s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_t - w_{t-1} \\right) - \\mathbf{B}^{4} \\left( b + s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_t - w_{t-1} \\right)  \\\\\n    &= \\left( b + s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_t - w_{t-1} \\right) - \\left( b + s_{[t-4]} - s_{[t-5]} + w_{t-4} - w_{t-5} \\right)  \\\\\n    &= \\left( s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_t - w_{t-1} \\right) - \\left( s_{[t]} - s_{[t-1]} + w_{t-4} - w_{t-5} \\right)  \\\\\n    &= w_t - w_{t-1} - w_{t-4} + w_{t-5}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis represents an \\(ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_4\\) process without a constant term.",
