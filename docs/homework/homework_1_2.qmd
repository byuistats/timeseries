## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the US unemployment series.

Please research the time series. The subheadings below has a link to a source to help you get started. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the US unemployment time series.

#### a) US unemployment

<https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm>

### Question 2 - Estimating the Trend: Annual Aggregation (10 points)

Please plot the US Unemployment time series and superimpose the annual mean of the series in the same graph. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.
