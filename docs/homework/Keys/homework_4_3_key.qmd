## Questions

### Question 1 - AR(1) with non-zero mean (10 points)

An AR(1) process with a non-zero mean $\mu$ can be expressed by either:

$$x_t-\mu=\alpha_1(x_{t-1}-\mu)+w_t \hspace{5mm}\mbox{or}\hspace{5mm}x_t=\alpha_0+\alpha_1x_{t-1}+w_t$$

#### a) Define a similar relationship for an AR(2) process with mean $\mu$

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
$$
x_t - \mu = \alpha_1(x_{t-1} - \mu) + \alpha_2(x_{t-2} - \mu) + w_t
$$
:::

### Question 2 - Stationarity (25 points)

#### a) Show that the series {$x_t$} given by $x_t=\frac{3}{2}x_{t-1}-\frac{1}{2}x_{t-2}+w_t$ is non-stationary. Please use the characteristic equation method.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
$$
1 - \frac{3}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B^2 = 0 
$$

We then calculate the value of $B$ using the polyroot function.

```{r}
polyroot(c(1, -3/2, .5)) |> abs() |> round(3)
```

This shows that $B$ is equal to 1 and 2. Because the absolute value of at least one of the coefficients is less than or equal to 1, it is non stationary.
:::

#### b) Please simulate the series {$x_t$} using 1000 realizations and calculate the first difference {$y_t$}, where $y_t=\nabla x_t$.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
n_rep <- 1000
alpha0 <- 0
alpha1 <- 1.5
alpha2 <- -0.5
sigma_sqr <- 9

dat_ts <- tibble(w = rnorm(n = n_rep, sd = sqrt(sigma_sqr))) |>
    mutate(
      index = 1:n(),
      x = 0
    ) |>
  mutate(y = w - lag(w)) |>
    tsibble::as_tsibble(index = index)

# Simulate x values
dat_ts$x[1] <- alpha0 + dat_ts$w[1]
dat_ts$x[2] <- alpha0 + alpha1 * ( dat_ts$x[1] - alpha0 ) + dat_ts$w[2]
for (i in 3:nrow(dat_ts)) {
  dat_ts$x[i] <- alpha0 + 
    alpha1 * ( dat_ts$x[i-1] - alpha0 ) + 
    alpha2 * ( dat_ts$x[i-2] - alpha0 ) + 
    dat_ts$w[i]
}

dat_ts |> 
  autoplot(.vars = x) +
    labs(
      x = "Time",
      y = "Simulated Time Series",
      title = paste("Simulated Values from an AR(2) Process with Mean", alpha0)
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
    )

dat_ts |> 
  autoplot(.vars = y) +
    labs(
      x = "Time",
      y = "Simulated Time Series",
      title = paste("Simulated Values from the first difference of an AR(2) Process with Mean", alpha0)
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
    )
```
:::

#### c) Prove that $y_t$ is stationary, use the characteristic equation method.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
$$
1 - (\frac{3}{2} - 1)B + \frac{1}{2}B^2 = 0 
$$

$$
1 - \frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B^2 = 0 
$$

We then calculate the value of $B$ using the polyroot function.

```{r}
polyroot(c(1, -1/2, .5)) |> abs() |> round(3)
```

This shows that $B$ is equal to 1.414. Because the absolute value of all of the coefficients is greater than 1, it is stationary.
:::

### Question 3 - Partial Correlogram (40 points)

#### a) Please use the Holt-Winters method to decompose the US Industrial Production Index. Please justify your choice of parameters. Use the context and your understanding of the series as part of your answers.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r, warning = FALSE}

ind_prod$date <- as.Date(ind_prod$date)

# Create a time series object
ind_prod_tsibble <- ts(ind_prod$ind_prod_indx, start = c(1919, 1), frequency = 12) 

ind_prod_tsibble <- ind_prod_tsibble %>% as_tsibble(index=date)


ipi_hw <- ind_prod_tsibble |>
  model(Additive = ETS(value ~
        trend("M", alpha=0.95, beta=0.001) +    
        error("M") +   
        season("M", gamma=0.05),    
        opt_crit = "amse", nmse = 1))  

autoplot(components(ipi_hw))

report(ipi_hw)

```

The values chosen were $\alpha$ at a value of 0.95, $\beta$ at a value of 0.001, $\gamma$ at a value of 0.05. A multiplicative model was chosen The high value for $\alpha$ was selected as there could be large fluctuations and economic shocks that could affect the series. By setting $\alpha$ at a higher value we place greater emphasis on more recent values to affect the level. $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are set to lower values, as the long term trend is consistent as is the seasonality. Any changes that may occur would be gradual and so the smaller values are set to reflect that.
:::

#### b) Plot the remainder (random) component of the decomposed series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
random <- ipi_hw |>
  residuals() |>
  as_tibble() 

```
:::

```{r}
ggplot(random, aes(x = index, y = .resid))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(x= "Date",
       y = "Residual",
       title = "Plot of the Random Component of the Decomposed Series")
```

#### c) Plot a partial correlogram of the random component of the the US Industrial Production Index. What kind of autoregressive process would you pick to model the random component?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}

pacf(random$.resid)

```

The partial correlogram of the remainder component indicates significant autocorrelation at lag 1 and lag 2, suggesting an AR(2) process is appropriate. The first lag shows a positive relationship, meaning the current value is influenced by the immediate past, while the second lag shows a weaker, negative relationship, introducing a slight oscillatory effect. Beyond lag 2, there are no practically significant autocorrelations, confirming that higher-order terms are unnecessary. The AR(2) model efficiently captures the short-term dependencies in the random component without overfitting, as well after determining the residual component of the AR(2) model, it demonstrates a white noise process and that the model effectively captures the small fluctuations in the data well.
