## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

#### a) **Output Gap**

#### b) **Cyclical Unemployment**

### Question 2 - Covariance and Correlation: Okun's Law (30) points)

Okun's Law is an empirical relationship defined as a negative correlation between the Output Gap and Cyclical Unemployment. If the economy is expanding, businesses are producing more, and unemployment tends to decrease. Conversely, during economic contractions or recessions, output shrinks, leading to an increase in unemployment.

Please use the data ***okuns*** to test whether Okun's Law applies to the US from 1960 to 2021.

##### a) Please create a scatter plot of the Output Gap in the x-axis and Cyclical Unemployment in the y-axis.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}

```
:::

##### b) Please calculate the covariance and correlation coefficient between the Output Gap and Cyclical Unemployment.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}

```
:::

##### c) Evaluate Okun's law. Is there sufficient evidence to suggest an empirical relationship between the Output Gap and Cyclical Unemployment?

### Question 3 - Correlation vs Causation: Spurious Searches (30 points)

::: quote
*"Every single person who confuses correlation and causation ends up dying."*

Hannah Fry
:::

Please use the data ***gs_night*** to evaluate the empirical relationship between the Google search terms for *night sweats* and *nightstand.*

##### a) Please create a scatter plot of the night sweat search index in the x-axis and nightstand search index in the y-axis.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}

```
:::

##### b) Please calculate the covariance and correlation between the night sweat search index and the nightstand search index.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}

```
:::

##### c) Please suggest a scenario where an increase in the frequency of searches for nightstand will cause higher searches for the term night sweats?

##### f) Are any of your suggestions plausible? What does that teach you about the difference between correlation and causation? Please elaborate.
