1882,-0.1,This data gives the change in global surface temperature 
1883,-0.16,compared to the long-term average from 1951 to 1980. 
1884,-0.27,Earth’s average surface temperature in 2023 was the 
1885,-0.33,warmest on record since recordkeeping began in 1880 
1886,-0.31,(source: NASA/GISS). 
1887,-0.36,
1888,-0.17,NASA’s analysis generally matches independent analyses 
1889,-0.1,prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
1890,-0.35,Administration (NOAA) and other research groups. 
1891,-0.22,"Overall, Earth was about 2.45 degrees Fahrenheit "
1892,-0.27,(or about 1.36 degrees Celsius) warmer in 2023 than 
1893,-0.31,in the late 19th-century (1850-1900) preindustrial average. 
1894,-0.31,The 10 most recent years are the warmest on record.
