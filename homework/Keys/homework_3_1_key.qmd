## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first step of any time series analysis is gathering context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

##### a) **Construction Equipment Manufacturing Orders and Shipments**

<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1f4dN>

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
**Data Collection Process:** 

The data in both series is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau via the Manufacturerâ€™s Shipments, Inventories, and Orders (M3) Survey. This survey is conducted on a *monthly* basis and involves distributing questionnaires to a representative sample of construction machinery manufacturers across the *United States*. Respondents provide information regarding their new orders, shipments, and other information, which are then aggregated, processed, and seasonally adjusted to account for regular fluctuations. The finalized data is published on FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), making it accessible for public use.

**Unit of Analysis:** The unit of analysis for both series is the total value in millions of US dollars in either shipments or orders during a given month. It is seasonally adjusted.

**Meaning of Each Observation:**

### Orders

Each observation in the orders time series represents the total value of new orders received by construction machinery manufacturers during a specific month. High new orders indicate increased demand and potential growth in the construction machinery sector, while declining orders may signal reduced economic activity or investment in this industry.

### Shipments

Each observation in the shipments time series shows the total value of shipments made by construction machinery manufacturers within a given month. The shipment values provide insights into the sales performance and overall economic health of the construction machinery manufacturing sector. An increase in shipment values suggests strong sales and strong market demand, whereas a decrease may indicate weakening sales or reduced demand. ##### add the context of this is the lagged series for orders

### Question 2 - Construction Equipment Manufacturing: Graphical Analysis (15 points)

##### a) Please plot a correlogram of the random components of the New Orders and Value of Shipments for the Construction Equipment Manufacturing data. Include both plots in the same illustration as exemplified in the Figure 5 of Chapter 3 Lesson 1.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
# Perform classical decomposition of construction equipment orders, extract components,
# and select the 'random' component along with 'month', renaming it to 'random_ord'.

  select(month, random) |>
  rename(random_ord = random)

# Perform classical decomposition of construction equipment shipments, extract components,
# and select the 'random' component along with 'month', renaming it to 'random_ship'.
shipments <- model(manu, feasts::classical_decomposition(constructionequip_ship)) |>
  components() |>
  select(month, random) |>
  rename(random_ship = random)

# Perform a right join on the 'orders' and 'shipments' datasets using the 'month' variable.
# This creates a combined dataset that includes the random components of both orders and shipments.
random_joint <- orders |>
  right_join(shipments, by = join_by(month))

# Calculate the ACF of the random component from the orders dataset,
# plot the ACF, and add a title to the plot.
acf_starts <- ACF(random_joint, y = random_ord) |> autoplot() +
  labs(title = "ACF of Random Component of Construction Equipment Orders")

# Calculate the ACF of the random component from the shipments dataset,
# plot the ACF, and add a title to the plot.
acf_completions <- ACF(random_joint, y = random_ship) |> autoplot() +
  labs(title = "ACF of Random Component of Construction Equipment Shipments")

# Combine the two ACF plots vertically to facilitate comparison between the
# random components of orders and shipments.
acf_starts / acf_completions

b)  Interpret and analyze the correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
The upper plot of the correlogram of the new orders, shows fewer significant autocorrelation values. This means that the number of construction orders is likely random in nature. We do see higher signficance levels clustered at 6 lag (month) intervals, lags 5,7 (sandwiching 6),11 (next to 12), & 18. This would suggest that some seasonal variation may still remain within our random compenent. So while these values are statistically significant there is no logical explaination or interpretation (apart from lingering seasonality) so they are *not* practically significant.
  
The lower plot, the correlogram of shipments exhibits very clear significance at lags 1 & 2. The remainder of the correlelogram displays clear lingering seasonality, as such the remaining lags while statistically significant lack practical significance and application. Lags 1 & 2 however can be practically interpreted, the correlations at lags 1 & 2 inform us that the value of our shipments one month ago can tell us a signicant amount about the expected values in the current month, and that the value of shipments 2 months ago can also tell us a significant amount about the expected values in the current month even after we have incorporated the additional information from lag(1) into our estimates.
In both cases the lags are positively correlated so a large value in shipments last month leads us to expect a large value in shipments this month (and vis-versa).

### Question 3 - Construction Equipment Manufacturing: Cross-correlation (30 points)

##### a) Please plot a cross-correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
random_joint %>%
  CCF(y = random_ship, x = random_ord) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "CCF for Random Component of Construction Equipment Orders (x) and Shipments (y)",
    x = "Lag (Months)",
    y = "Correlation Coefficient",
    caption = "Negative lags: past values of 'x' relate to current values of 'y' \nPositive lags: past values of 'y' relate to current values of 'x'"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +  # Use a clean, minimal theme
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = "bold"), # Make title more prominent
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14), # Style subtitle consistently
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), # Increase axis label size for readability
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12), # Increase axis text size
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 10, face = "italic") # Add a descriptive caption for context
  )+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1, 1, 0.1)) + # Adjust y-axis breaks for better readability
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-24, 24, 4)) # Adjust x-axis breaks to display more details on lags

##### b) Please interpret the cross-correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series. Include descriptions of the statistical and practical significance of the results.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}

Focusing first on negative lags, we can distinguish between the lags that are statistically and practically significant vs those that are only statistically significant. We see that lags -1,-2, & -3 all sit beyond the line of signifance at 0.1. With -3 being so close to the line its reasonable to focus primarily on -1 and -2. These values are both positively correlated at a negative lag and as such the interpretation in context for our series' would be that; high values of orders in the previous two months will lead to high values of shipments in the current month. Apart from these lags the remainder of the left side is random in nature or can be
