## Questions

### Question 1 - Estimating the Trend: Centered Moving Average (10 points)

Please plot the US Unemployment time series and superimpose the centered moving average series $\hat{m}_{t}$ in the same graph. Don't use an R command; rather, do it by coding $\hat{m}_{t}$ like in Chapter 1: Lesson 3. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.

### Question 2 - Seasonal Averages: Side-by-Side Box Plots by Month (10 points)

Please create a box plot to illustrate the monthly averages in the US Unemployment time series. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)

mydata2 = unemp_rate.t %>% 
    mutate(month = as.factor(month)) %>%
    group_by(month) %>% 
    mutate(OutlierFlag = case_when((value<quantile(value,1/3,na.rm=T)-1.5*IQR(value,na.rm=T)) | (value>quantile(value,2/3,na.rm=T)+1.5*IQR(value,na.rm=T)) ~ "Outlier", TRUE ~"NonOutlier"))

# boxplot
p <- ggplot(mydata2 %>% filter(OutlierFlag=="NonOutlier"), aes(x = month, y = value)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)+
    geom_point(data=mydata2 %>% filter(OutlierFlag=="Outlier"),aes(group=month,label1=year,label2=value),color="#E69F00",size=1)+

    x = "Month",  # X-axis label
    y = "Unemployment Rate (%)",  # Y-axis label
    title = "Monthly Unemployment Rate Distribution"  # Plot title
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb) +  # Label X-axis with month names

  theme_bw() +  # Use a clean black-and-white theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  # Center the plot title


output <- ggplotly(p, tooltip=c("label1","label2"))

# makes boxplot outliers invisible and hover info off

### Question 3 - Seasonal Averages: Analysis (20 points)

##### a) Describe the seasonality of the US unemployment time series. Comment on the series' periods of highest and lowest unemployment. Are there any notable outliers?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
Here in the box plot we can see that the highest median unemployment rates are typically around the beginning of the year from January to Februrary, then later in the year, June and July have higher unemployment rates once again. The periods with the lowest unemployment range from April and May, as well as September and October. The unemployment values here can be due to seasonal employment patterns. One noticiable outlier here is found in the month of April. In April 2020, the highest unemployment rate was ever recorded due to the COVID pandemic. However, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a month that has a significantly higher unemployment rate than the other.
:::

##### b) Please explain the patterns you found. Include information from your prior research on the series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
Perhaps one reason as to why there are increases in unemployment rates at the beginning of the year industries experience significant employment fluctuations due to lay offs holiday season demand in retail for workers. 

Another clear example is a wave of new job seekers enters the market around this time as recent high school and college graduates begin looking for work. Since it can take some time for these individuals to secure employment, it temporarily drives up unemployment rates. Additionally, there is rise in unemployment before switching to summer months, largely due to shifts in industries like agriculture and tourism, where jobs often peak or wind down, leading to employment changes.
