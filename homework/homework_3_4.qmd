## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

**Average Price of Electricity per Kilowatt-Hour in U.S.: City Average**

### Question 2 - US Average Price of Electricity: Additive Holt-Winters Forecasting (25 points)

#### a) Please use the Holt-Winters smoothing method to the series.

## Missing data

We will discuss this more in class but for those who are curious in this dataset originally there was no value for September 1985. In this case with only one seemingly random value missing from our data the implications of how we fill the value are less impactful, regardless the method chosen here was to average the values from $t_{-1}$ & $t_{+1}$ then use the resulting value to fill the missing data. This can be accomplished quickly using the following base R code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
# Average the values from the periods before(82) and after(84) the missing period(83).
value <- (avgkwhr$usenergyprice[82]+avgkwhr$usenergyprice[84])/2
# this evaluates to 0.835

# Fill missing value with average of surrounding values
avgkwhr_tsbl$usenergyprice[83] <- value


```

For your convience the data provided for this Homework assignment has already been filled.

### Question 3 - Real US Average Price of Electricity: Additive Holt-Winters Forecasting (25 points)

The upward trend of the series is mostly due to inflation, the generalized increase in prices throughout the economy. One way to quantify inflation is to use a price index, like the Personal Consumption Expenditures Deflator (PCE).The series [HERE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEPILFE) shows that prices in the US have climbed steadily over the last 60 years.Because energy is an important part of the economy, it's likely that energy prices have followed a similar pattern. Adjusting a series with nominal prices, like the price of electricity, to real prices that account for inflation is simple, divide the original series by the price index. The data set imported below is the real price of electricity, which is the US Average Price of Electricity divided by the PCE index excluding food and energy prices (PCEPILFE). Repeat steps a) to d) for the updated series.
