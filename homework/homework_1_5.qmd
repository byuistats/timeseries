## Questions

### Question 1: Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

#### a) **Vessels Cleared in Foreign Trade for United States**

<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M03022USM583NNBR>

:::

### Question 2: Seasonally Adjusted Series - Calculation and Plot (10 points)

#### a) Decompose the Vessels Cleared in Foreign Trade series using the mul   tiplicative decomposition model. Show the first 10 rows of results from the decomposition as shown in the Time Series Notebook.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
# Please provide your code here

```
:::

#### b) Illustrate the original, trend, and the seasonally adjusted series in the same plot. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.

```{r}
# Please provide your code here

```
:::

### Question 3: Seasonally Adjusted Series - Analysis (30 points)

#### a) Plot the random component of the multiplicative decomposition from Q2a.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
# Please provide your code here

```
:::

#### b) Use the additive decomposition method to decompose the Vessels Cleared in Foreign Trade series. Plot the random component.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}
# Please provide your code here

```
:::

#### c) Please describe the differences between the random component series and use it as part of your justification for why we use the multiplicative decomposition model instead of the additive model to seasonally adjust the series.
