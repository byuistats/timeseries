## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

### Question 2 - Manufacturer's Inventory: Autocorrelation and autocovariance (10 points)

#### a) Please calculate the list of autocorrelation and autocovariance values for the Manufacturer's Inventory series.

```{r}



```
:::

#### b) If autocovariance and autocorrelation are trying to evaluate a similar linear relationship across time in our series, why do we get different values for autocorrelation and autocovariance at the same lag.

### Question 3 - Manufacturer's Inventory: Stationary (20 points)

Weak stationarity is a form of stationarity important for the analysis of time series data. A time series is said to be weakly stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocovariance are constant over time. Here are the key components of weak stationarity:

*Constant Mean:* The mean of the time series remains constant over time. This doesn't necessarily mean that the time series is centered around zero; it just implies that the average value remains the same throughout the observed period.

*Constant Variance:* The variance of the time series is uniform across all time points. Like the mean, this doesn't imply that the variance must be zero, just that it doesn't change systematically with time.

*Constant Autocovariance:* The autocovariance between any two observations of the time series depends only on the time lag between them and not on the absolute positions of the observations in time. This implies that the dependence structure of the time series remains constant over time.

#### a) Please split the time series into two halves according to the date recorded, the earlier half of the data and the latter part of the data. Calculate the mean, variance, and autocovariance for each half. *Note:* *(it doesn't really matter if it's precisely half. An approximate middle is sufficient.)*

#### c) The variance function for a times series, $\sigma^2(t)=E[(x_t-\mu)^2]$, is defined for the entire ensemble. Why is determining whether a time series has constant variance so difficult using sample data?
