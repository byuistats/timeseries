## Questions

### Question 1 - Estimating the Trend: Centered Moving Average (10 points)

Please plot the US Unemployment time series and superimpose the centered moving average series $\hat{m}_{t}$ in the same graph. Don't use an R command; rather, do it by coding $\hat{m}_{t}$ like in Chapter 1: Lesson 3. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.
