## Class Discussion: Theory Supporting the EWMA

Our objective is to predict a future value given the first $n$ observations of a time series. One example would be to forecast sales of an existing product in a stable market.

We assume the following about the time series:

-   There is no systematic trend or seasonal effects (or that these have been removed).

-   The mean is non-stationary (can change), but we have no idea about the direction.




::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="Check Your Understanding"}
Match the following definitions to the appropriate term.

::: {style="display: flex;"}
<div>

1.  A future observation of a time series
2.  Model assumed in EWMA agorithm
3.  Non-stationary mean
4.  Random correlated error terms
5.  A fixed constant between 0 and 1

</div>

<div>

A.  $\alpha$
B.  $\mu_t$
C.  $w_t$
D.  $x_{n+k}$
E.  $x_t = \mu_t + w_t$

</div>
:::
:::

The idea is that we will use past observations to predict future observations. Our best prediction of future observations under this model is the mean of the estimate at the time of the last observation. In symbols, if we want to predict the value of the time series at time $n+k$, we use our estimate of the time series at time $n$:

$$
\hat x_{n+k \mid n} = a_n, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{where}~~ k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (3.16)
$$ 

<a id="ewma">Here</a> are three equivalent expressions that define the EWMA estimation technique:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  a_t &= \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) a_{t-1} & (3.15) \\
  a_t &= \alpha (x_t - a_{t-1} ) + a_{t-1} & (3.17) \\
  a_t &= \alpha x_t + \alpha(1-\alpha) x_{t-1} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^3 x_{t-3} + \cdots & (3.18) 
\end{align}
```
We assume that $a_1 = x_1$.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="Check Your Understanding"}
-   What happens if $\alpha$ is close to 1?
-   What happens if $\alpha$ is close to 0?
-   What is a common "compromise" value for $\alpha$?
-   Show that Equation (3.15) and (3.17) are equivalent.
-   How would you show that Equation (3.18) is equivalent to Equation (3.17)?

## Class Activity: Practice Applying the EWMA (20 min)

We will use the following data to practice applying the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique. Use $\alpha = 0.2$.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# simulate correlated normal random data
x1 <- get_toy_data()

cat("x <- c(",paste(x1, collapse = ", "),")")
```

Start filling @tbl-at-et by calculating the values of $a_t$ for each value of $x_t$.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-at-et
#| tbl-cap: "Calculation of $a_t$ and $e_t$ for a sample time series"

  )

ewma_toy_df$a_t_computation[1] = paste0("$$",ewma_toy_df$x_t[1], "$$")

for (t in 2:length(x1)) {
  ewma_toy_df$a_t[t] <- alpha * ewma_toy_df$x_t[t] + (1 - alpha) * ewma_toy_df$a_t[t-1]
  ewma_toy_df$a_t_computation[t] <- paste("$$", alpha, "\\cdot", ewma_toy_df$x_t[t], "+", "(1 - ",alpha,") \\cdot", round(ewma_toy_df$a_t[t-1],3), "=", round(ewma_toy_df$a_t[t],3), "$$")

### One-Step-Ahead Prediction Errors 

#### Definition

If we have a time series $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ and start with $a_1 = x_1$, we can compute the value of $a_t$ if $2 \le t \le n$.
We define the one-step-ahead prediction error, $e_t$ as

$$
  e_t = x_t - \hat x_{t|t-1} = x_t - a_{t-1}
$$

#### Calculation of $\alpha$ in R

R uses the one-step-ahead prediction error to estimate $\alpha$. It chooses $\alpha$ to minimize

$$
  SS1PE = \sum_{t=2}^n e_t^2 = e_2^2 + e_3^2 + e_4^2 + \cdots + e_n^2
$$

where $a_1 = x_1$.

If the mean of a long time series has not changed much, then this will produce a value of $\alpha$ that is unduly small. A small value of $\alpha$ prevents the model from responding to rapid future changes in the time series.

The data set spans `r num_days_in_ts` days. 
There is a strong daily pattern, which can be seen by the `r num_days_in_ts` pairs of peaks and valleys. It might be easier to see if we look at the observations from the first `r num_days_to_plot` days.

-   What do you no notice about this time series?
-   During what parts of the day does the traffic flow tend to be slowest? fastest? What is the reason for this behavior?
:::


Next, we compute the decomposition. We expect that that traffic will fluctuate with daily seasonality. The number of five-minute periods in a day is:

$$
\underbrace{\frac{60}{5}}_{\substack{\text{Number of} \\ \text{5-minute periods} \\ \text{per hour}}} \cdot \underbrace{24}_{\substack{\text{Number of} \\ \text{hours} \\ \text{per day}}} = ~~ 288~~\text{five-minute periods per day}
$$

That is, the time series will follow a cycle that repeats every 288 five-minute intervals. Due to the complexity of the time series, we will indicate this to R in our function call. (Try replacing "speed \~ season(288)" in the classical_decomposition command with "speed" and see what happens!)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Applying the EWMA when there is a trend and/or seasonal variation

One assumption for the EWMA is that there is no trend or seasonal variation. If present, we need to eliminate the  trend and seasonal variation before applying the EWMA algorithm. In this case, we decompose the time series and compute the EWMA for the random component. Finally, we add the trend and seasonal components back in to get the EWMA estimate for the time series.
:::

These data demonstrate distinct seasonal variation. We will need to apply the EWMA algorithm to the random component and later add the seasonal component and trend to our EWMA estimate.

## Class Activity: EWMA in R (10 min)

We will compute the EWMA for the random component of the New York highway speed data in R.
We have already decomposed the model, so we have isolated the estimated values for the random component. This is a portion of the tsibble `ny_speeds_decompose`:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-speed-random-EWMA
#| tbl-cap: "A portion of the tsibble containing the EWMA for the random component of the traffic data"
#| echo: false

num_header_footer_rows <- 3
num_extra_na_rows <- 1
num_body_rows <- 3

table1 <- ny_speeds_decompose |> convert_df_to_char() |> head(288 / 2 + num_body_rows) |> concat_partial_table(num_header_footer_rows, num_body_rows + num_extra_na_rows) |>
  convert_df_to_char()
table2 <- ny_speeds_decompose |> convert_df_to_char() |> row_of_vdots()
table3 <- ny_speeds_decompose |> convert_df_to_char() |> tail(288 / 2 + num_body_rows) |> concat_partial_table(num_body_rows + num_extra_na_rows, num_header_footer_rows)

bind_rows(table1, table2, table3) |>
  display_table()
```

::: {.callout-warning}

When applying EWMA to the random component of the time series, delete the variable `.model` and all `NA` values from the data frame. If you neglect this step, there will be errors in the code below.
:::

We drop the variable `.model` and omit all NA values. (Remember the first half-day and the last half-day in the time series do not yield estimates for the random component.)

```{r}
ny_speeds_random <- ny_speeds_decompose |>
  na.omit() |>                                # Omit all NA values
  select(-.model)                             # Eliminate the variable .model
```

The following code can be used to execute the EWMA algorithm on the random component using $\alpha = 0.2$.

```{r}
ny_speeds_model1 <- ny_speeds_random |>
  model(Additive = ETS(random ~
                         trend("A", alpha = 0.2, beta = 0) +
                         error("A") + season("N"),
                       opt_crit = "amse", nmse = 1))
report(ny_speeds_model1)
```

Now, we calculate the value of *SS1PE*.

```{r}
sum(components(ny_speeds_model1)$remainder^2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

<!-- Here is a plot of the time series with the EWMA superimposed. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| code-fold: true -->
<!-- #| code-summary: "Show the code" -->

<!-- augment(ny_speeds_model1) |> -->
<!--   ggplot(aes(x = index, y = random)) + -->
<!--   geom_line() + -->
<!--   geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, color = "Fitted")) + -->
<!--   labs(color = "") -->
<!-- ``` -->





<!-- Fit the model with alpha unspecified -->

```{r}
#| include: false

ny_speeds_model0 <- ny_speeds_random |>
  model(Additive = ETS(random ~
                         trend("A", beta = 0) +
                         error("A") +
                         season("N"),
                       opt_crit = "amse", nmse = 1))
report(ny_speeds_model0)

alpha_est <- ny_speeds_model0[[1]][[1]][["fit"]][["par"]][["estimate"]][1] |> round(4)

min_ss1pe <- sum(components(ny_speeds_model0)$remainder^2, na.rm = TRUE) |> round(2)

options(scipen = 999) # Turn off scientific notation
```

<!-- Check Your Understanding -->

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="Check Your Understanding"}

-   Modify the code analyzing the New York traffic speed data by deleting the argument `alpha = 0.2`. 
<!-- This will allow R to optimize $\alpha$ by minimizing the *SS1PE*. -->
    -   What value of $\alpha$ is obtained?
    -   What is the value of the *SS1PE* for this value of $\alpha$?
-   Choose values of $\alpha$ slightly less than and slightly greater than `r alpha_est`. 
    -   Can you find a value of $\alpha$ that gives you a smaller *SS1PE* than `r min_ss1pe`?
